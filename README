(i) The c program basically runs through the entire input file using fgetc grabbing each character.
it ignores the character if it is not a letter, number, space, or /0 (newline). If it is a letter or number, it adds to a string, and reallocates an additional byte of memory to the string for use in the future. If it is a space or new line, it adds the \0 character to the end and starts iterating through the linked list starting at the head comparing the string to the string in the node. if it finds it, it adds 1 to count of that node. if it reaches the end or reaches a word that comes after alphabetically, then it creates a new node and puts count to 1. This ends with a sorted linked list. At the end we iterate through the linked list and output the data to a file. 

(ii) We have no experience in c (we had some in c++ so there is some crossover), but none in shell scripting.

(iii) We had difficulties in run time because we chose to reallocate memory for each character, which tends to be resource intensive. other than that we had no major difficulties.
