the
present
edition
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
that
edited
by
my
father
with
my
great-uncles
final
corrections
and
published
by
mr
john
murray
in
1859
several
reprints
of
that
edition
have
testified
to
the
continued
popularity
of
the
work
and
the
necessity
for
the
present
issue
shows
that
an
acquaintance
of
nearly
half
a
century
has
not
yet
wearied
the
public
of
the
standard
translation
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
the
secret
of
mr
lanes
success
is
to
be
found
partly
in
the
instinctive
sympathy
for
the
spirit
of
the
east
which
enabled
him
faithfully
to
reproduce
the
characteristic
tone
of
the
original
and
partly
in
the
rich
store
of
illustrations
of
oriental
life
and
thought
contained
in
his
notes
in
the
various
cheap
versions
based
upon
gallands
french
paraphrase
the
eastern
tone
and
local
colour
is
wholly
wanting
and
the
peculiarities
of
life
and
manners
which
contrast
so
markedly
with
those
of
the
west
are
left
unnoted
and
unexplained
such
versions
may
serve
in
an
inadequate
degree
to
make
the
arabian
nights
known
to
those
who
care
only
for
the
bare
stories
but
educated
readers
who
are
capable
of
something
more
than
the
mere
enjoyment
of
the
romance
and
desire
to
understand
the
character
and
habits
of
the
actors
and
the
spectators
find
in
mr
lanes
translation
and
in
his
only
a
complete
satisfaction
of
their
want
it
is
not
merely
a
scholars
edition
though
no
oriental
student
can
afford
to
be
without
it
but
beyond
this
narrow
circle
it
has
ever
appealed
to
the
wide
audience
that
cares
to
know
the
famous
books
of
the
world
in
their
most
perfect
and
faithful
reflections

vi

the
actual
moment
is
an
opportune
one
for
the
reappearance
of
the
work
egypt
just
now
holds
a
foremost
place
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
it
is
of
egypt
that
the
thousand
and
one
nights
have
most
to
tell
indian
or
persian
as
many
of
the
tales
are
in
their
origin
their
setting
is
almost
purely
egyptian
and
though
the
place
may
be
nominally
baghdad
or
india
or
even
furthest
china
it
is
in
mediÃval
cairo
in
the
days
of
the
memlooks
that
the
scene
of
the
arabian
nights
is
really
laid
the
people
described
are
not
hindoos
or
chinese
but
arabs
and
egyptians
as
they
lived
and
moved
in
the
fifteenth
century
when
some
of
the
beautiful
mosques
and
tombs
that
still
make
cairo
the
delight
of
artists
were
being
built
and
the
devastating
hand
of
the
ottoman
turk
had
not
yet
been
laid
on
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
for
a
minute
picture
of
arabian
society
as
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
the
thousand
and
one
nights
have
no
rival
and
it
is
mr
lanes
appreciation
of
this
picture
and
the
wealth
of
illustration
lavished
upon
it
in
his
notes
that
render
his
edition
the
most
complete
commentary
we
possess
on
muslim
life
and
manners
religion
and
literature
and
make
it
an
indispensable
supplement
to
his
famous
account
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
modern
egyptians
the
poetry
of
eastern
life
is
rapidly
fading
away
under
the
effacing
touch
of
european
civilisation
the
characteristic
society
in
which
an
haroon-er-rasheed
an
aboo-nuwas
a
kafoor
a
saladin
or
a
kaÃt-bey
revelled
and
jested
and
conquered
is
fast
becoming
matter
of
history
rather
than
of
experience
a
field
for
the
antiquary
instead
of
the
traveller
and
it
is
well
that
we
can
reconstruct
it
in
the
pages
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
whose
compiler
saw
it
when
it
was
still
almost
in
its
golden
prime
and
in
the
modern
egyptians
whose
author
knew
it
when
it
still
preserved
the
romantic
character
which
has
charmed
and
fascinated
readers
of
every
age
and
condition

formed
of
the
arabic
words
signifying
in
the
name

the
head
of
a
muslim
work
written
doubly
and

the
editors
preface

a
new
edition
of
this
work
having
been
required
mr
lane
was
requested
to
undertake
the
correction
of
the
press
but
severe
literary
labours
allowing
him
no
leisure
for
this
object
he
named
me
as
his
pupil
in
the
study
of
arabic
familiar
with
his
writings
and
for
many
years
resident
with
him
in
cairo
to
fill
in
some
measure
his
place
i
have
undertaken
this
duty
with
great
diffidence
from
a
sense
of
my
own
deficiencies
and
his
extensive
knowledge
but
i
have
felt
that
i
could
at
least
insure
the
correctness
of
the
text
and
a
scrupulous
adherence
to
his
wishes
the
present
edition
is
printed
without
any
variations
of
my
own
except
those
which
are
marked
as
such
and
have
been
submitted
to
mr
lane
from
a
copy
of
the
first
and
complete
editionviii
with
corrections
and
additions
made
by
mr
lane
from
time
to
time
since
its
first
publication
these
however
from
the
accuracy
with
which
the
translation
was
made
and
the
fulness
of
the
notes
are
not
very
numerous
the
same
reasons
have
also
caused
my
own
notes
to
be
few
i
believe
that
my
uncles
notes
are
complete
in
themselves
and
that
i
have
sometimes
erred
even
in
the
rare
exceptions
i
have
made
on
the
side
of
unnecessary
addition

an
edition
of
any
book
not
superintended
by
the
author
is
sometimes
regarded
with
distrust
i
would
therefore
assure
the
reader
that
in
this
instance
he
may
depend
even
on
the
punctuation
the
whole
having
been
laboriously
collated
with
mr
lanes
annotated
copy
notwithstanding
the
great
delay
which
this
process
has
occasioned
in
the
printing
of
the
work

i
have
called
this
a
complete
edition
to
distinguish
it
from
two
others
which
have
been
published
without
mr
lanes
notes
or
his
method
of
writing
oriental
words
and
with
other
variations
from
the
standard
edition
the
public
appreciation
of
these
notes
and
of
the
advantage
of
correctly-written
foreign
words
is
i
conceive
proved
by
the
call
for
the
present
edition
on
the
subject
of
the
mode
of
writing
oriental
words
in
european
characters
i
need
say
little
for
the
controversy
has
well
nigh
died
out
the
present
generation
does
not
regard
antiquated
blunders
as
the
familiar
names
of
childhood
but
rather
strives
to
attain
accuracy
in
all
things
and
those
few
who
still
cling
to
mahomet
or
mahomed
should
consistently
exhume
the
forgotten
mahound
of
the
crusades

the
translators
views
respecting
the
origin
and
literary
history
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
will
be
found
fully
expressed
in
the
review
at
the
end
of
the
third
volume
in
his
original
preface
he
stated
the
remarks
which
i
here
submit
to
the
reader
being
written
when
only
one-third
of
the
work
to
which
they
principally
relate
is
printed
must
unavoidably
be
more
defective
than
they
would
be
if
reserved
until
a
later
period
during
the
progress
of
the
publication
i
may
be
enabled
to
form
clearer
and
more
complete
views
of
the
several
subjects
which
might
with
propriety
beix
fully
discussed
at
the
head
of
my
translation
and
i
think
it
better
therefore
to
append
at
the
close
of
the
work
many
observations
which
i
originally
intended
to
prefix
to
the
first
volume
he
has
therefore
wished
me
to
remodel
the
preface
transferring
all
portions
relating
to
the
subjects
in
question
to
the
review
retaining
whatever
may
more
properly
stand
at
the
commencement
of
the
work
and
adding
any
matter
of
my
own

the
object
with
which
the
translation
was
made
is
best
expressed
in
the
words
of
mr
lanes
preface

my
undertaking
to
translate
anew
the
tales
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
implies
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
version
which
has
so
long
amused
us
but
i
must
express
my
objections
with
respect
to
the
latter
in
plain
terms
and
this
i
shall
do
by
means
of
a
few
words
on
the
version
of
galland
from
which
it
is
derived
for
to
him
alone
its
chief
faults
are
to
be
attributed
i
am
somewhat
reluctant
to
make
this
remark
because
several
persons
and
among
them
some
of
high
and
deserved
reputation
as
arabic
scholars
have
pronounced
an
opinion
that
his
version
is
an
improvement
upon
the
original
that
the
thousand
and
one
nights
may
be
greatly
improved
i
most
readily
admit
but
as
confidently
do
i
assert
that
galland
has
excessively
perverted
the
work
his
acquaintance
with
arab
manners
and
customs
was
insufficient
to
preserve
him
always
from
errors
of
the
grossest
description
and
by
the
style
of
his
version
he
has
given
to
the
whole
a
false
character
thus
sacrificing
in
a
great
measure
what
is
most
valuable
in
the
original
workâi
mean
its
minute
accuracy
with
respect
to
those
peculiarities
which
distinguish
the
arabs
from
every
other
nation
not
only
of
the
west
but
also
of
the
east
deceived
by
the
vague
nature
of
gallands
version
travellers
in
persia
turkey
and
india
have
often
fancied
that
the
arabian
tales
describe
the
particular
manners
of
the
natives
of
those
countries
but
no
one
who
has
read
them
in
the
original
language
having
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
arabs
can
be
of
this
opinion
it
is
in
arabian
countries
and
especially
in
egypt
that
we
see
the
people
the
dresses
and
the
buildings
which
it
describesx
in
almost
every
case
even
when
the
scene
is
laid
in
persia
in
india
or
in
china

convinced
of
the
truth
of
this
assertion
i
consider
myself
possessed
of
the
chief
qualifications
for
the
proper
accomplishment
of
my
present
undertaking
from
my
having
lived
several
years
in
cairo
associating
almost
exclusively
with
arabs
speaking
their
language
conforming
to
their
general
habits
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactitude
and
received
into
their
society
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
since
the
downfall
of
the
arab
empire
of
baghdÃd
cairo
has
been
the
chief
of
arabian
cities
its
memlook
suláÃns
introduced
into
egypt
in
their
youth
naturally
adopted
to
a
great
degree
the
manners
of
its
native
inhabitants
which
the
osmÃnlee
turks
in
later
days
have
but
little
altered
cairo
is
the
city
in
which
arabian
manners
now
exist
in
the
most
refined
state
and
such
i
believe
to
have
been
the
case
when
the
present
work
was
composed

mr
lanes
first
two
visits
to
egypt
were
made
when
for
the
last
time
arab
manners
and
customs
as
they
existed
in
the
age
of
the
arabian
nights
could
be
studied
and
his
translation
was
written
very
shortly
after
his
second
return
to
england
though
some
of
the
tales
maybe
indian
or
persian
in
origin
in
their
present
state
they
exhibit
a
picture
of
the
manners
modes
of
thought
and
language
of
the
court
and
times
of
the
memlook
suláÃns
of
egypt
which
nearly
resembled
in
these
points
those
of
the
khaleefehs
of
baghdÃd
or
the
great
arab
empire
de
sacy
and
von
hammer
the
two
celebrated
orientalists
who
differed
widely
in
opinion
as
to
the
origin
of
the
book
agreed
that
the
tales
in
which
the
khaleefeh
hÃroon
er-rasheed
is
introduced
the
best
with
few
exceptions
in
the
collection
are
egyptian
in
character
but
since
the
modern
egyptians
were
described
by
mr
lane
all
things
in
the
east
have
changed
and
every
day
witnesses
the
decay
of
some
old
custom
to
be
followed
by
a
bastard
european
imitation
during
mohammad
alees
rule
all
traces
of
the
state
and
circumstance
of
the
memlook
court
gradually
passed
away
european
dress
has
displaced
oriental
costume
cloth
of
gold
and
dresses
ofxi
honour
european
architecture
elbows
the
quaint
beauty
of
the
old
arab
capital
and
the
cavalcade
of
fifty
horsemen
around
a
grandee
is
succeeded
by
an
english
carriage
that
profanes
the
quiet
streets
of
the
city
and
frightens
away
both
efreets
and
their
memory
mr
lane
saw
the
last
of
cairo
in
its
integrity
and
he
has
not
overstated
his
qualifications
as
author
of
the
modern
egyptians
for
the
task
of
translating
the
arabian
nights

of
the
copy
from
which
this
translation
was
made
and
the
method
observed
in
its
execution
i
may
again
quote
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
mr
lane
saysâ

i
have
taken
as
my
general
standard
of
the
original
text
the
cairo
edition
lately
printed
it
being
greatly
superior
to
the
other
printed
editions
and
probably
to
every
manuscript
copy1
it
appears
to
agree
almost
exactly
with
the
celebrated
ms
of
von
hammer
than
which
no
copy
more
copious
i
believe
exists
and
contains
all
the
tales
in
the
old
version
except
those
which
as
von
hammer
says
galland
appears
to
have
taken
from
other
works
arabic
persian
and
turkish
in
the
royal
library
of
paris
the
manuscript
from
which
it
was
printed
was
carefully
collated
and
corrected
by
a
very
learned
man
the
sheykh
abd-er-raámÃn
eá-áaftee
esh-sharáÃwee
who
also
superintended
the
progress
of
the
work
through
the
press
but
in
addition
to
the
value
conferred
upon
it
by
the
corrections
of
this
sheykh
the
copy
from
which
the
whole
of
my
translation
is
made
except
in
a
few
xiiinstances
possesses
an
advantage
which
i
believe
renders
it
incomparably
superior
to
any
other
now
existing
it
has
been
again
revised
and
corrected
and
illustrated
with
numerous
manuscript
notes
by
a
person
whom
i
think
i
may
safely
pronounce
the
first
philologist
of
the
first
arab
college
of
the
present
day
the
sheykh
moáammad
eiyÃd
eá-áanáÃwee
or
more
properly
eá-áanditÃee
his
notes
are
chiefly
philological
and
explanatory
of
words
which
do
not
belong
to
the
classical
language
and
many
of
them
are
of
very
great
assistance
to
me
though
most
of
them
i
find
unnecessary
from
the
knowledge
of
the
modern
arabic
which
i
have
acquired
during
my
intercourse
with
the
people
who
speak
it
his
corrections
of
the
text
are
numerous
and
as
they
would
interest
very
few
persons
i
have
mentioned
but
few
of
them
in
the
notes
to
my
translation
notwithstanding
a
strong
temptation
that
i
felt
to
do
otherwise
in
order
that
arabic
scholars
might
be
assisted
to
judge
of
the
fidelity
of
my
version
by
comparing
it
with
the
text
of
the
cairo
edition2
to
the
pieces
of
poetry
which
are
interspersed
throughout
the
work
he
has
paid
especial
attention
not
only
correcting
the
errors
which
he
found
in
them
but
also
always
adding
the
vowel-points
and
generally
commentaries
or
explanations
thus
i
have
shewn
that
i
am
very
greatly
indebted
to
him
for
his
learned
labours
i
should
however
add
that
i
have
ventured
to
differ
from
him
in
interpreting
a
few
words
having
found
more
appropriate
meanings
assigned
to
them
by
arabs
in
parts
not
visited
by
him
or
such
meanings
given
in
printed
dictionaries
with
which
he
is
unacquainted
and
i
have
also
corrected
a
few
errors
which
have
escaped
his
notice3
without
the
valuable
xiiiaid
which
he
has
afforded
me
i
would
not
have
attempted
the
translation
nor
with
it
would
i
have
done
so
were
it
not
for
the
advantage
that
i
derive
from
my
having
lived
among
arabs
no
translator
can
always
be
certain
that
from
twenty
or
more
significations
which
are
borne
by
one
arabic
word
he
has
selected
that
which
his
author
intended
to
convey
but
circumstanced
as
i
am
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
confident
that
i
have
never
given
to
a
word
or
phrase
in
this
work
a
meaning
which
is
inconsistent
with
its
presenting
faithful
pictures
of
arab
life
and
manners

i
have
thought
it
right
to
omit
such
tales
anecdotes
c
as
are
comparatively
uninteresting
or
on
any
account
objectionable
in
other
words
i
insert
nothing
that
i
deem
greatly
inferior
in
interest
to
the
tales
in
the
old
version
certain
passages
which
in
the
original
work
are
of
an
objectionable
nature
i
have
slightly
varied
but
in
doing
this
i
have
been
particularly
careful
to
render
them
so
as
to
be
perfectly
agreeable
with
arab
manners
and
customs
it
was
originally
my
intention
to
omit
almost
the
whole
of
the
poetry
thinking
that
the
loss
of
measure
and
rhyme
and
the
impossibility
of
preserving
the
examples
of
paronomasia
and
some
other
figures
with
which
they
abound
would
render
translations
of
them
generally
intolerable
to
the
reader
but
afterwards
i
reflected
that
the
character
of
the
work
would
be
thus
greatly
altered
and
its
value
as
illustrating
arab
manners
and
feelings
much
diminished
i
therefore
determined
to
preserve
a
considerable
number
of
select
pieces
chosen
either
for
their
relative
merits
or
because
required
by
the
context
the
number
of
those
comprised
in
the
first
volume
of
my
translation
is
nearly
half
of
the
number
contained
in
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
original
work
but
in
several
cases
i
have
omitted
one
or
more
verses
of
a
piece
as
unsuitable
or
for
some
other
reason
and
in
a
few
instances
i
have
given
only
the
first
verse
or
the
first
couplet
these
pieces
of
poetry
are
not
in
general
to
be
regarded
as
the
compositions
of
the
author
or
authors
of
the
work
theyxiv
appear
to
be
mostly
borrowed
from
others
and
many
of
them
are
taken
from
the
works
of
celebrated
poetsâto
avoid
the
tedious
interruptions
which
occur
in
the
original
at
the
close
of
each
night
i
have
divided
the
translation
into
chapters
each
of
which
consists
of
one
tale
or
of
two
or
more
tales
connected
one
with
another
and
have
merely
mentioned
the
night
with
which
each
chapter
commences
and
that
with
which
it
terminates

the
original
work
being
designed
solely
for
the
entertainment
of
arabs
i
add
copious
notes
to
the
translation
to
render
it
more
intelligible
and
agreeable
to
the
english
reader
these
are
entirely
my
own
except
in
those
cases
when
i
have
stated
otherwise4
and
my
general
object
in
them
has
been
to
give
such
illustrations
as
may
satisfy
the
general
reader
without
obliging
him
to
consult
other
works
in
many
of
them
i
endeavour
to
shew
by
extracts
from
esteemed
arabic
histories
and
scientific
and
other
writings
chiefly
drawn
from
mss
in
my
possession
as
well
as
by
assertions
and
anecdotes
that
i
have
heard
and
conduct
that
i
have
witnessed
during
my
intercourse
with
arabs
that
the
most
extravagant
relations
in
this
work
are
not
in
general
regarded
even
by
the
educated
classes
of
that
people
as
of
an
incredible
nature
this
is
a
point
which
i
deem
of
much
importance
to
set
the
work
in
its
proper
light
before
my
countrymen
i
have
resided
in
a
land
where
genii
are
still
firmly
believed
to
obey
the
summons
of
the
magician
or
the
owner
of
a
talisman
and
to
act
in
occurrences
of
every
day
and
i
have
listened
to
stories
of
their
deeds
related
as
facts
by
persons
of
the
highest
respectability
and
by
some
who
would
not
condescend
to
read
the
tales
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
merely
because
they
are
fictions
and
not
written
in
the
usual
polished
style
of
literary
compositions

i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
literary
history
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
is
discussed
in
mr
lanes
review
xvappended
to
this
translation
in
the
course
of
my
arabic
studies
and
more
especially
since
i
have
been
occupied
in
editing
the
present
work
i
have
endeavoured
to
form
an
unbiassed
judgment
on
this
difficult
question
and
all
my
researches
have
confirmed
me
in
agreeing
with
the
opinions
there
expressed
von
hammer
was
inclined
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
supposed
persian
or
indian
origin
of
these
tales
while
de
sacy
on
the
other
hand
rejected
the
belief
in
any
connection
between
the
old
work
and
the
more
modern
contending
that
the
latter
was
an
independent
production
the
discovery
however
of
a
passage
in
an
arabic
author
by
von
hammer
since
the
publication
of
de
sacys
essay
and
mr
lanes
preface
has
placed
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
and
scholars
are
now
agreed
notwithstanding
de
sacys
pleasant
sarcasm
and
the
weight
of
his
great
name
that
the
thousand
nights
formed
in
some
measure
the
prototype
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
on
the
other
hand
de
sacys
keen
appreciation
of
the
modern
and
chiefly
egyptian
or
arab
character
of
the
book
in
its
present
form
must
be
fully
recognised
and
was
indeed
thus
acknowledged
by
von
hammer
himself
the
manners
dresses
and
modes
of
thought
portrayed
by
it
are
arab
throughout
even
in
the
stories
which
are
probably
retained
from
the
persian
or
indian
original
of
which
that
of
the
magic
horse
is
the
best
example
in
this
translation
besides
those
relating
to
the
court
and
adventures
of
hÃroon
er-rasheed
which
as
i
have
before
remarked
are
curiously
egyptian
many
others
appear
to
have
been
remodelled
if
not
actually
composed
in
egypt
it
is
not
less
true
that
these
tales
are
generally
the
best
in
the
collection
if
those
of
the
slave
kÃfoor
of
azeez
and
azeezeh
and
of
es-sindibÃd
be
excepted
for
these
certainly
are
inferior
to
none
the
more
colloquial
and
familiar
stories
point
to
the
same
origin
such
as
that
of
alÃ-ed-deen
abu-sh-shÃmÃt
which
is
pervaded
by
egyptian
characteristics
in
phraseology
and
in
other
respects
that
of
aboo-áeer
and
aboo-áeer
and
that
of
maáºroof
the
stories
founded
mainly
on
persian
or
indian
originals
appear
to
bexvi
those
in
which
supernatural
beings
play
the
most
conspicuous
parts
and
as
mr
lane
remarks
these
are
generally
deficient
in
verses
although
the
converse
does
not
hold
good
of
the
former
class
the
anecdotes
are
mostly
historical
many
of
them
are
in
the
notes
identified
with
similar
ones
in
other
arabic
works
and
almost
all
are
of
arab
origin

the
evidences
of
a
late
date
scattered
through
the
book
may
be
additions
of
copyists
and
reciters
but
considered
with
reference
to
its
general
character
they
have
a
certain
weight
that
cannot
be
overlooked
this
is
carefully
stated
in
the
review

mr
lanes
arguments
in
favour
of
the
collective
thousand
and
one
nights
being
an
individual
work
and
not
one
of
many
similar
collections
seem
to
me
to
be
conclusive
not
the
least
important
of
these
is
the
fact
that
no
similar
collection
is
known
to
exist
nor
is
mentioned
by
any
arab
author
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
old
thousand
nights
which
i
believe
he
has
demonstrated
to
be
the
prototype
in
a
remote
degree
of
the
thousand
and
one
to
cite
the
words
of
the
preface
on
the
question
of
the
original
of
the
work
as
it
is
known
to
usâi
have
shewn
it
to
be
my
opinion
that
all
the
complete
copies
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
now
known
are
in
the
main
derived
though
not
immediately
from
one
original
and
i
hold
the
same
opinion
with
respect
to
every
fragment
containing
the
commencement
of
the
work
not
regarding
the
work
as
wholly
original
nor
as
the
first
of
its
kind
for
many
of
the
tales
which
it
contains
are
doubtless
of
different
and
early
origins
and
i
think
that
its
general
plan
is
probably
borrowed
from
a
much
older
production
bearing
the
same
title
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
or
the
thousand
nights
a
translation
of
a
persian
work
having
a
corresponding
title
namely
hezÃr
afsÃneh
one
thing
is
certainâthat
the
thousand
and
one
nights
or
the
thousand
nights
translated
from
the
persian
was
much
older
than
the
work
now
known
by
that
title
and
also
extremely
different
from
the
latter

when
these
facts
are
considered
in
reference
to
each
other
thexvii
date
assigned
in
the
review
to
the
composition
of
the
work
cannot
reasonably
be
regarded
as
far
from
the
truth
it
is
in
egypt
and
especially
in
the
memlook
court
that
we
must
look
to
find
the
people
the
manners
and
the
habits
of
thought
of
the
arabian
nights
while
the
style
of
the
language
in
which
they
are
written
is
that
which
we
might
expect
from
an
egyptian
of
those
times
who
unskilled
in
the
classical
arabic
yet
endeavouring
to
imitate
it
was
doubtless
more
generally
intelligible
then
than
he
is
now
to
the
modern
egyptians
this
assumption
of
the
old
language
i
may
remark
is
and
always
has
been
characteristic
of
all
learned
arabs
be
they
egyptians
or
natives
of
other
arabian
countries
for
such
egypt
truly
is
but
no
other
instance
exists
of
a
work
of
fiction
in
which
the
attempt
fails
so
singularly
in
affecting
the
classical
or
retaining
the
modern
tongue
while
all
other
arabic
tales
are
certainly
composed
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
the
modern
egyptian
romances
are
mostly
written
in
the
colloquial
dialect
of
every-day
life
but
those
which
are
of
older
date
are
not
modernized
as
some
have
supposed
against
all
reason
the
thousand
and
one
nights
to
be
such
an
alteration
would
be
without
a
parallel
in
arabic
literature
as
mr
lane
proves
in
the
review
in
a
way
to
relieve
me
of
the
necessity
of
further
alluding
here
to
this
particular
question
the
thousand
and
one
nights
exhibit
a
style
which
would
be
unfamiliar
to
the
audience
of
the
reciter
of
romances
without
attaining
to
the
classical
diction
and
the
conclusion
is
forced
on
us
that
the
work
exhibits
the
language
of
a
by-gone
generation
which
taking
into
consideration
the
other
indications
of
its
age
and
country
is
it
can
scarcely
be
disputed
that
of
the
later
period
of
the
memlook
rulers
of
egypt
before
the
turkish
conquest
of
that
country
in
the
words
of
mr
lanes
prefaceâmost
of
the
tales
which
it
contains
are
doubtless
of
an
older
origin
and
many
of
them
founded
upon
very
old
traditions
and
legends
but
all
these
traditions
or
legends
were
evidently
remodelled
so
as
to
become
pictures
of
the
state
of
manners
which
existed
among
the
arabs
and
especially
among
those
of
egypt
at
the
period
here
mentionedxviii
and
i
think
that
the
composer
of
the
work
or
each
of
the
composers
if
one
commenced
and
another
completed
it
was
an
egyptian

but
a
more
popular
subject
than
its
obscure
origin
is
the
literary
merit
of
this
work
the
rare
fascination
of
these
old
arab
stories
their
supernatural
romance
excessive
love
quaint
philosophy
and
grotesque
humour
have
since
the
days
of
galland
secured
to
them
more
readers
than
any
other
profane
work
the
translation
of
galland
with
all
its
lameness
puerility
and
indecency
gained
for
them
a
hold
which
has
never
been
relaxed
and
it
only
required
the
appearance
of
a
scholarlike
and
readable
translation
freed
from
these
defects
to
make
them
generally
accepted
in
english
families
the
fashion
of
travelling
in
the
east
has
not
a
little
added
to
the
desire
for
a
standard
and
annotated
edition
of
a
work
unique
even
in
those
lands
of
genii
and
adventure
in
its
remarkable
portrayal
of
eastern
character
life
and
when
closely
translated
idiom
the
humour
of
the
book
now
broad
now
subtle
who
does
not
delight
in
kÃfoor
and
his
half
lie
renders
the
comic
stories
generally
superior
to
the
romantic
but
the
pathos
perhaps
excels
every
other
beauty
the
story
of
shems-en-nahÃr
is
remarkable
for
this
characteristic
and
that
of
azeez
and
azeezeh
first
published
in
this
translation
surpasses
in
delicate
tenderness
any
arab
tale
with
which
we
are
acquainted

of
the
critical
value
of
mr
lanes
translation
i
ought
scarcely
to
speak
yet
i
may
observe
that
students
of
arabic
make
it
a
text-book
in
reading
the
original
while
the
english
reader
not
uncommonly
forgets
that
it
is
a
translation
and
detects
not
the
literal
accuracy
of
its
rendering
of
an
unfamiliar
or
unknown
language

i
have
adverted
to
the
system
adopted
in
transcribing
foreign
words
and
i
now
conclude
these
preliminary
remarks
intended
only
to
render
the
learned
review
easier
of
perusal
to
the
general
reader
and
to
smooth
his
first
steps
in
a
strange
land
by
quoting
with
some
slight
improvements
by
mr
lane
the
explanation
of
that
system
given
in
the
preface
to
the
first
editionxix

in
writing
arabic
and
other
oriental
words
in
the
present
work
i
have
employed
a
system
congenial
with
our
language
and
of
the
most
simple
kind
and
to
this
system
i
adhere
in
every
case
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
as
well
as
truth5
some
persons
have
objected
to
my
writing
in
this
manner
a
few
familiar
words
which
are
found
in
our
dictionaries
but
they
will
excuse
me
for
remarking
that
general
usage
is
not
altogether
accordant
with
their
opinion
almost
every
author
i
believe
now
writes
koran
or
kurÃn
and
pasha
or
pacha
for
our
dictionary-words
alcoran
and
bashaw
and
most
of
our
best
authors
on
arabian
history
of
late
have
written
khalif
for
caliph
in
a
work
relating
to
a
people
who
pronounce
the
arabic
w
as
v
i
should
write
vezeer
for
the
arabic
word
wezeer
but
to
do
so
when
the
subject
is
arabian
i
consider
inexpedient
and
in
this
opinion
i
am
upheld
by
a
great
majority
of
literary
and
other
friends
whom
i
have
consulted
on
the
subject
in
the
proportion
of
five
to
one
i
may
add
that
dr
johnson
has
written
in
his
dictionary
vizier
properly
wazir
and
if
we
express
the
arabic
vowels
by
their
italian
equivalents
it
is
properly
wazÃr
or
wezÃrâthe
system
which
i
here
employ
requires
but
little
explanation
the
general
reader
may
be
directed
to
pronounce

a
as

our

the
consonants
distinguished
by
a
dot
beneath
has
a
peculiarly
hard
sound

having
avoided
as
much
as
possible
making
use
of
accents
i
must
request
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
that
a
single
vowel
when
not
marked
with
an
accent
is
always
short
and
that
a
double
vowel
or
diphthong
at
the
end
of
a
word
when
not
so
marked
is
not
accented
welee
for
instance
being
pronounced
wÄlee
also
that
the
acute
accent
does
not
always
denote
the
principal
or
only
emphasis
hÃroon
being
pronounced
hÃroÃn
that
a
vowel
with
a
grave
accent
only
occurring
at
the
end
of
a
word
is
not
emphasized
though
it
is
long
and
that
dh
gh
kh
sh
and
th
when
not
divided
by
a
hyphen
represent
each
a
single
arabic
letter8

i
have
only
to
add
one
more
extract
from
mr
lanes
preface

many
of
the
engravings
which
are
so
numerously
interspersed
in
this
work
will
considerably
assist
to
explain
both
the
text
and
xxithe
notes
and
to
insure
their
accuracy
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
i
have
supplied
the
artist
with
modern
dresses
and
with
other
requisite
materials
thus
he
has
been
enabled
to
make
his
designs
agree
more
nearly
with
the
costumes
c
of
the
times
which
the
tales
generally
illustrate
than
they
would
if
he
trusted
alone
to
the
imperfect
descriptions
which
i
have
found
in
arabic
works9
except
in
a
few
cases
when
i
had
given
him
such
directions
as
i
deemed
necessary
his
original
designs
have
been
submitted
to
me
and
in
suggesting
any
corrections
i
have
as
much
as
possible
avoided
fettering
his
imagination
which
needs
no
eulogy
from
me
he
has
acquired
a
general
notion
of
arabian
architecture
from
the
great
work
of
murphy
on
the
arabian
remains
in
spain
and
from
the
splendid
and
accurate
work
on
the
alhambra
by
messrs
goury
and
jones
and
through
the
kindness
of
my
friend
mr
hay
of
linplum
he
has
been
allowed
to
make
a
similar
use
of
a
very
accurate
and
very
beautiful
collection
of
drawings
of
a
great
number
of
the
finest
specimens
of
arabian
architecture
in
and
around
cairo
executed
by
m
pascal
coste
and
now
the
property
of
mr
hay10
he
has
also
consulted
a
number
of
oriental
drawings
and
various
other
sources
my
acknowledgments
to
other
persons
i
have
expressed
in
several
of
the
notes

the
portion
which
is
comprised
in
the
first
volume
of
this
translation
terminates
with
part
of
the
hundred
and
thirty-seventh
night
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
remarkâfirst
that
there
is
less
to
omit
in
the
early
part
of
the
original
work
than
in
the
laterâsecondly
that
the
nights
in
the
early
part
are
xxiigenerally
much
longer
than
in
the
subsequent
portion
the
first
hundred
nights
without
the
introduction
comprising
213
pages
in
the
cairo
edition
of
the
original
work
the
second
hundred
149
pages
the
third
107
the
fourth
106
the
fifth
9411âthirdly
that
a
similar
observation
applies
to
the
notes
which
are
inserted
in
my
translation
those
appended
to
the
early
tales
being
necessarily
much
more
copious
than
the
others

1
two
other
printed
editions
were
also
used
by
mr
laneâthat
of
the
first
two
hundred
nights
printed
at
calcutta
and
in
consequence
of
the
loss
by
shipwreck
of
nearly
the
whole
impression
of
the
first
volume
never
completed
and
that
of
breslau
the
former
differs
much
in
matter
and
manner
from
any
other
known
copy
the
latter
which
was
edited
to
the
close
of
the
seven
hundred
and
third
night
by
professor
habicht
and
completed
by
professor
fleischer
is
far
inferior
to
all
the
others
one
other
edition
has
appeared
in
the
arabic
that
of
calcutta
or
the
calcutta
edition
of
the
complete
work
it
was
brought
from
cairo
and
is
apparently
though
not
immediately
from
the
same
original
as
the
boolÃá
edition
i
have
continually
referred
to
it
for
various
readings
without
finding
any
one
of
importance
and
here
i
must
animadvert
on
the
practice
of
german
orientalists
of
wasting
their
own
time
and
their
readers
patience
in
collecting
such
various
readings
of
a
work
like
the
thousand
and
one
nights
as
must
necessarily
be
the
result
of
the
carelessness
or
the
ignorance
of
copyists
and
reciters
the
habit
is
unfortunately
adopted
by
some
englishmen
who
seem
to
imagine
that
all
that
is
german
is
therefore
learnedâed

2
i
must
here
state
that
peculiar
qualifications
are
required
to
enable
a
person
to
judge
of
the
fidelity
of
my
translation
the
original
work
contains
many
words
not
comprised
in
any
printed
dictionary
and
a
great
number
of
words
used
in
senses
which
no
such
dictionary
gives
in
cases
of
both
these
kinds
i
am
guided
either
by
the
explanations
of
the
sheykh
moáammad
eiyÃd
or
by
my
having
been
long
in
the
habit
of
noting
down
new
words
during
conversation
with
arabs
and
in
the
perusal
of
works
in
which
they
are
explained

3
as
i
hope
that
the
copy
which
he
has
rendered
so
valuable
may
be
of
great
utility
to
many
students
of
the
arabic
language
when
i
have
ceased
to
profit
by
it
i
may
mention
here
that
the
few
corrections
and
some
explanations
which
i
have
inserted
upon
the
margins
of
pages
will
be
easily
distinguished
from
those
of
the
sheykh
moáammad
eiyÃd
by
the
difference
of
our
handwritings

4
when
i
mention
my
sheykh
in
the
notes
the
sheykh
moáammad
eiyÃd
is
the
person
to
whom
i
allude
in
several
instances
when
he
has
given
brief
explanations
of
words
phrases
customs
c
with
which
i
was
previously
acquainted
i
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
name
him
as
my
authority
in
notes
which
i
have
inserted
though
i
have
sometimes
done
so

5
english
writers
generally
express
the
arabic
vowels
and
diphthongs
by
their
nearest
italian
equivalents
this
mode
is
very
well
suited
for
those
who
know
and
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
words
so
transcribed
but
for
others
i
think
it
objectionable
our
language
is
altogether
much
more
suitable
to
the
purpose
of
expressing
the
sounds
of
arabic
than
the
italian
besides
i
believe
it
is
the
custom
of
every
other
european
nation
in
transcribing
oriental
words
to
employ
a
system
congenial
with
its
own
language
in
a
former
work
i
made
use
of
a
double
h
to
express
a
very
strong
arabic
aspirate
as
others
had
done
before
me
and
the
word
hhÃgg
or
hhÃjj
was
pointed
out
by
a
critic
as
one
remarkably
uncouth
von
hammer
in
a
review
of
that
work
writes
the
same
word
and
very
properly
as
a
german
writer
hadschdsch

6
strictly
speaking
it
has
a
sound
between
that
of
a
in
bad
and
that
of
u
in
bud
sometimes
approximating
more
to
the
former
and
sometimes
to
the
latter

7
its
sound
however
often
approximates
to
that
of
a
in
ball

8
dh
is
pronounced
as
th
in
that
gh
represents
a
guttural
sound
like
that
produced
in
gargling
kh
represents
a
guttural
sound
like
that
which
is
produced
in
expelling
saliva
from
the
throat
and
approaching
nearer
to
the
sound
of
á
a
very
strong
aspirate
than
to
that
of
k
sh
is
pronounced
as
in
shall
and
th
as
in
thin

es-suyooáee

his
áosn

after
quoting
a
description
of
certain
dresses
says
as
to
their
dresses
of
honour
and
those
of
the
wezeers
and
others
of
similar
rank
i
have
struck
out
the
description
of
them
from
the
words
of
ibn-faál-allah
for
they
are
composed
of
silk
and
gold
which
is
forbidden
by
the
law
and
i
have
obliged
myself
not
to
mention
in
this
book
any
thing
of
which
i
should
be
questioned
in
the
world
to
come
if
it
be
the
will
of
godâi
have
never
seen
any
arabic
work
with
drawings
of
costumes
but
persian
drawings
are
often
useful
in
explaining
arab
dresses

10
these
drawings
with
some
few
exceptions
have
now
been
published
from
copies
in

unto

of

that

the

which
have

to

which

such
are
the
tales
of
a
thousand
and
one
nights
with
their
romantic
stories
and
their
fables

it
is
related
but
god
alone
is
all-knowing3
as
well
as
all-wise
and
almighty
and
all-bountiful
that
there
was
in
ancient
times
a
king4
of
the
countries
of
india
and
china
possessing
numerous
troops
and
guards
and
servants
and
domestic
dependents
and
he
had
two
sons
one
of
whom
was
a
man
of
mature
age
and
the
other
a
youth
both
of
these
princes
were
brave
horsemen
but
especially
the
elder
who
inherited
the
kingdom
of
his
father
and
governed
his
subjects
with
such
justice
that
the
inhabitants
of
his
country
and
whole
empire
loved
him
he
was
called
king
shahriyÃr5
his
younger
brother
was
named
shÃh-zemÃn6
and
was
king
of
samaráand7
the
administration
of
their
governments
was
conducted
with
rectitude
each
of
them
ruling
over
his
subjects
with
justice
during
a
period
of
twenty
years
with
the
utmost
enjoyment
and
happiness
after
this
period
the
elder
king
felt
a
strong
desire
to
see
his
brother
and
ordered
his
wezeer8
to
repair
to
him
and
bring
him

the
wezeer
presenting
the
letter
to
shÃh-zemÃn
having
taken
the
advice
of
the
wezeer
on
this
subject9
he
immediately
gave
orders
to
prepare
handsome
presents
such
as
horses
adorned
with
gold
and
costly
jewels
and
memlooks
and
beautiful
virgins
and
expensive
stuffs10
he
then
wrote
a
letter
to
his
brother
expressive
of
his
great
desire
to
see
him11
and
having
sealed
it
and
given
it
to
the
wezeer
together
with
the
presents
above
mentioned
he
ordered
the
minister
to
strain
his
nerves
and
tuck
up
his
skirts
and
use
all
expedition
in
returning
the
wezeer
answered
without
delay
i
hear
and
obey
and
forthwith
prepared
for
the
journey
he
packed
his
baggage
removed
the
burdens
and
made
ready
all
his
provisions
within
three
days
and
on
the
fourth
day
he
took
leave
of
the
king
shahriyÃr
and
went
forth
towards
the
deserts
and
wastes
he
proceeded
night
and
day
and
each
of
the
kings
under
the
authority
of
king
shahriyÃr
by
whose
residence
he
passed
came
forth
to
meet
him12
with
costly
presents
and
gifts
of
gold
and
silver
and
entertained
him
three
days13
after
which
on
the
fourth
day
he
accompanied
him
one
days
journey
and
took
leave
of
him
thus
he
continued
on
his
way
until
he
drew
near
to
the
city
of
samaráand
when
he
sent
forward
a
messenger
to
inform
king
shÃh-zemÃn
of3
his
approach
the
messenger
entered
the
city
inquired
the
way
to
the
palace
and
introducing
himself
to
the
king
kissed
the
ground
before
him14
and
acquainted
him
with
the
approach
of
his
brothers
wezeer
upon
which
shÃh-zemÃn
ordered
the
chief
officers
of
his
court
and
the
great
men
of
his
kingdom
to
go
forth
a
days
journey
to
meet
him
and
they
did
so
and
when
they
met
him
they
welcomed
him
and
walked
by
his
stirrups
until
they
returned
to
the
city
the
wezeer
then
presented
himself
before
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
greeted
him
with
a
prayer
for
the
divine
assistance
in
his
favour
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
informed
him
of
his
brothers
desire
to
see
him
after
which
he
handed
to
him
the
letter
the
king
took
it
read
it
and
understood
its
contents15
and
answered
by
expressing
his
readiness
to
obey
the
commands
of
his
brother
but
said
he
addressing
the
wezeer
i
will
not
go
until
i
have
entertained
thee
three
days
accordingly
he
lodged
him
in
a
palace
befitting
his
rank
accommodated
his
troops
in
tents
and
appointed
them
all
things
requisite
in
the
way
of
food
and
drink
and
so
they
remained
three
days
on
the
fourth
day
he
equipped
himself
for4
the
journey
made
ready
his
baggage
and
collected
together
costly
presents
suitable
to
his
brothers
dignity

these
preparations
being
completed
he
sent
forth
his
tents
and
camels
and
mules
and
servants
and
guards
appointed
his
wezeer
to
be
governor
of
the
country
during
his
absence
and
set
out
towards
his
brothers
dominions
at
midnight16
however
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
in
his
palace
an
article
which
he
should
have
brought
with
him
and
having
returned
to
the
palace
to
fetch
it
he
there
beheld
his
wife
sleeping
in
his
bed
and
attended
by
a
male
negro
slave
who
had
fallen
asleep
by
her
side
on
beholding
this
scene
the
world
became
black
before
his
eyes
and
he
said
within
himself
if
this
is
the
case
when
i
have
not
departed
from
the
city
what
will
be
the
conduct
of
this
vile
woman
while
i
am
sojourning
with
my
brother
he
then
drew
his
sword
and
slew
them
both
in
the
bed
after
which
he
immediately
returned
gave
orders
for
departure
and
journeyed
to
his
brothers
capital

shÃh-zemÃn
after
having
killed
his
wife
shahriyÃr
rejoicing
at
the
tidings
of
his
approach
went
forth
to
meet
him
saluted
him
and
welcomed
him
with
the
utmost
delight
he
then
ordered
that
the
city
should
be
decorated
on
the
occasion17
and
sat
down
to
entertain
his
brother
with
cheerful
conversation
but
the
mind
of
king
shÃh-zemÃn
was
distracted
by
reflections
upon
the
conduct
of
his
wife
excessive
grief
took
possession
of
him
and
his
countenance
became
sallow
and
his
frame
emaciated
his
brother
observed
his
altered
condition
and
imagining
that
it
was
occasioned
by
his
absence
from
his
dominions
abstained
from
troubling
him
or5
asking
respecting
the
cause
until
after
the
lapse
of
some
days
when
at
length
he
said
to
him
o
my
brother
i
perceive
that
thy
body
is
emaciated
and
thy
countenance
is
become
sallow
he
answered
o
brother
i
have
an
internal
soreâand
he
informed
him
not
of
the
conduct
of
his
wife
which
he
had
witnessed
shahriyÃr
then
said
i
wish
that
thou
wouldest
go
out
with
me
on
a
hunting
excursion
perhaps
thy
mind
might
so
be
divertedâbut
he
declined
and
shahriyÃr
went
alone
to
the
chase18

meeting
of
shahriyÃr
and
shÃh-zemÃn
now
there
were
some
windows
in
the
kings
palace
commanding
a
view
of
his
garden
and
while
his
brother
was
looking
out
from
one
of
these
a
door
of
the
palace
was
opened
and
there
came
forth
from
it
twenty
females
and
twenty
male
black
slaves
and
the
kings
wife
who
was
distinguished
by
extraordinary
beauty
and
elegance19
accompanied
them
to
a
fountain
where
they
all
disrobed
themselves
and
sat
down
together
the
kings
wife
then
called
out
o
mesood20
and
immediately
a
black
slave
came
to
her
and
embraced
her
she
doing
the
like
so
also
did
the
other
slaves
and
the
women
and
all
of
them
continued
revelling
together
until
the
close
of
the
day
when
shÃh-zemÃn
beheld
this
spectacle
he
said
within
himself
by
allah
my
affliction
is
lighter
than
this
his
vexation
and
grief
were
alleviated
and
he
no
longer
abstained
from
sufficient
food
and
drink

when
his
brother
returned
from
his
excursion
and
they
had6
saluted
each
other
and
king
shahriyÃr
observed
his
brother
shÃh-zemÃn
that
his
colour
had
returned
that
his
face
had
recovered
the
flush
of
health
and
that
he
ate
with
appetite
after
his
late
abstinence
he
was
surprised
and
said
o
my
brother
when
i
saw
thee
last
thy
countenance
was
sallow
and
now
thy
colour
hath
returned
to
thee
acquaint
me
with
thy
stateâas
to
the
change
of
my
natural
complexion
answered
shÃh-zemÃn
i
will
inform
thee
of
its
cause
but
excuse
my
explaining
to
thee
the
return
of
my
colourâfirst
said
shahriyÃr
relate
to
me
the
cause
of
the
change
of
thy
proper
complexion
and
of
thy
weakness
let
me
hear
itâknow
then
o
my
brother
he
answered
that
when
thou
sentest
thy
wezeer
to
me
to
invite
me
to
thy
presence
i
prepared
myself
for
the
journey
and
when
i
had
gone
forth
from
the
city
i
remembered
that
i
had
left
behind
me
the
jewel
that
i
have
given
thee
i
therefore
returned
to
my
palace
for
it
and
there
i
found
my
wife
sleeping
in
my
bed
and
attended
by
a
black
male
slave
and
i
killed
them
both
and
came
to
thee
but
my
mind
was
occupied
by
reflections
upon
this
affair
and
this
was
the
cause
of
the
change
of
my
complexion
and
of
my
weakness
now
as
to
the
return
of
my
colour
excuse
my
informing
thee
of
its
causeâbut
when
his
brother
heard
these
words
he
said
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
acquaint
me
with
the
cause
of
the
return
of
thy
colourâso
he
repeated
to
him
all
that
he
had
seen
i
would
see
this
said
shahriyÃr
with
my
own
eyeâthen
said
shÃh-zemÃn
give
out
that
thou
art
going
again
to
the
chase
and
conceal
thyself
here
with
me
and
thou
shalt
witness
this
conduct
and
obtain
ocular
proof
of
it


shahriyÃrs
return
from
the
chase
shahriyÃr
upon
this
immediately
announced
that
it
was
his
intention
to
make
another
excursion
the
troops
went
out
of
the
city7
with
the
tents
and
the
king
followed
them
and
after
he
had
reposed
awhile
in
the
camp
he
said
to
his
servants
let
no
one
come
in
to
meâand
he
disguised
himself
and
returned
to
his
brother
in
the
palace
and
sat
in
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
garden
and
when
he
had
been
there
a
short
time
the
women
and
their
mistress
entered
the
garden
with
the
black
slaves
and
did
as
his
brother
had
described
continuing
so
until
the
hour
of
the
afternoon-prayer

garden
of
shahriyÃrs
palace
efreet
and
lady
when
king
shahriyÃr
beheld
this
occurrence
reason
fled
from
his
head
and
he
said
to
his
brother
shÃh-zemÃn
arise
and
let
us
travel
whither
we
please
and
renounce
the
regal
state
until
we
see
whether
such
a
calamity
as
this
have
befallen
any
other
person
like
unto
us
and
if
not
our
death
will
be
preferable
to
our
life
his
brother
agreed
to
his
proposal
and
they
went
out
from
a
private
door
of
the
palace
and
journeyed
continually
days
and
nights
until
they
arrived
at
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
a
meadow
by
a
spring
of
water
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
they
drank
of
this
spring
and
sat
down
to
rest
and
when
the
day
had
a
little
advanced
the
sea
became
troubled8
before
them
and
there
arose
from
it
a
black
pillar
ascending
towards
the
sky
and
approaching
the
meadow
struck
with
fear
at
the
sight
they
climbed
up
into
the
tree
which
was
lofty
and
thence
they
gazed
to
see
what
this
might
be
and
behold
it
was
a
jinnee21
of
gigantic
stature
broad-fronted
and
bulky
bearing
on
his
head
a
chest22
he
landed
and
came
to
the
tree
into
which
the
two
kings
had
climbed
and
having
seated
himself
beneath
it
opened
the
chest
and
took
out
of
it
another
box
which
he
also
opened
and
there
came
forth
from
it
a
young
woman
fair
and
beautiful
like
the
shining
sun
when
the
jinnee
cast
his
eyes
upon
her
he
said
o
lady
of
noble
race
whom
i
carried
off
on
thy
wedding-night
i
have
a
desire
to
sleep
a
littleâand
he
placed
his
head
upon
her
knee
and
slept
the
damsel
then9
raised
her
head
towards
the
tree
and
saw
there
the
two
kings
upon
which
she
removed
the
head
of
the
jinnee
from
her
knee
and
having
placed
it
on
the
ground
stood
under
the
tree
and
made
signs
to
the
two
kings
as
though
she
would
say
come
down
and
fear
not
this
efreet23
they
answered
her
we
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
excuse
us
in
this
matter
but
she
said
i
conjure
you
by
the
same
that
ye
come
down
and
if
ye
do
not
i
will
rouse
this
efreet
and
he
shall
put
you
to
a
cruel
death
so
being
afraid
they
came
down
to
her
and
after
they
had
remained
with
her
as
long
as
she
required
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
purse
and
drew
out
from
this
a
string
upon
which
were
ninety-eight
seal-rings24
and
she
said
to
them
know
ye
what
are
these
they
answered
we
know
notâthe
owners
of
these
rings
said
she
have
all
of
them
been
admitted
to
converse
with
me
like
as
ye
have
unknown
to
this
foolish
efreet
therefore
give
me
your
two
rings25
ye
brothers
so
they
gave
her
their
two
rings
from
their
fingers
and
she
then
said
to
them
this
efreet
carried
me
off
on
my
wedding-night
and
put
me
in
the
box
and
placed
the
box
in
the
chest
and
affixed
to
the
chest
seven
locks
and
deposited
me
thus
imprisoned
in
the
bottom
of
the
roaring
sea
beneath
the
dashing
waves
not
knowing
that
when
one
of
our
sex
desires
to
accomplish
any
object
nothing
can
prevent
her
in
accordance
with
this
says
one
of
the
poetsâ

never
trust
in
women
nor
rely
upon
their
vows
for
their
pleasure
and
displeasure
depend
upon
their
passions
they
offer
a
false
affection
for
perfidy
lurks
within
their
clothing
by
the
tale
of
yoosuf26
be
admonished
and
guard
against
their
stratagems
dost
thou
not
consider
that
iblees
ejected
adam
by
means
of
woman
and
another
poet
saysâ

abstain
from
censure
for
it
will
strengthen
the
censured
and
increase
desire
into
violent
passion
if
i
suffer
such
passion
my
case
is
but
the
same
as
that
of
many
a
man
before
me
for
greatly
indeed
to
be
wondered
at
is
he
who
hath
kept
himself
safe
from
womens
artifice27
when
the
two
kings
heard
these
words
from
her
lips
they
were
struck
with
the
utmost
astonishment
and
said
one
to
the
other
if
this
is
an
efreet
and
a
greater
calamity
hath
happened
unto
him
than
that
which
hath
befallen
us
this
is
a
circumstance
that
should
console
usâand
immediately
they
departed
and
returned
to
the
city

as
soon
as
they
had
entered
the
palace
shahriyÃr
caused
his
wife
to
be
beheaded
and
in
like
manner
the
women
and
black
slaves10
and
thenceforth
he
made
it
his
regular
custom
every
time
that
he
took
a
virgin
to
his
bed
to
kill
her
at
the
expiration
of
the
night
thus
he
continued
to
do
during
a
period
of
three
years
and
the
people
raised
an
outcry
against
him
and
fled
with
their
daughters
and
there
remained
not
a
virgin
in
the
city
of
a
sufficient
age
for
marriage28
such
was
the
case
when
the
king
ordered
the
wezeer
to
bring
him
a
virgin
according
to
his
custom
and
the
wezeer
went
forth
and
searched
and
found
none
and
he
went
back
to
his
house
enraged
and
vexed
fearing
what
the
king
might
do
to
him

now
the
wezeer
had
two
daughters
the
elder
of
whom
was
named
shahrazÃd
and
the
younger
dunyÃzÃd
the
former
had
read
various
books
of
histories
and
the
lives
of
preceding
kings
and
stories
of
past
generations
it
is
asserted
that
she
had
collected
together
a
thousand
books
of
histories
relating
to
preceding
generations
and
kings
and
works
of
the
poets
and
she
said
to
her
father
on
this
occasion
why
do
i
see
thee
thus
changed
and
oppressed
with
solicitude
and
sorrows
it
has
been
said
by
one
of
the
poetsâ

tell
him
who
is
oppressed
with
anxiety
that
anxiety
will
not
last
as
happiness
passeth
away
so
passeth
away
anxiety
when
the
wezeer
heard
these
words
from
his
daughter
he
related
to
her
all
that
had
happened
to
him
with
regard
to
the
king
upon
which
she
said
by
allah
o
my
father
give
me
in
marriage
to
this
king
either
i
shall
die
and
be
a
ransom
for
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
muslims
or
i
shall
live
and
be
the
cause
of
their
deliverance
from
him29âi
conjure
thee
by
allah
exclaimed
he
that
thou
expose
not
thyself
to
such
perilâbut
she
said
it
must
be
so
then
said
he
i
fear
for
thee
that
the
same
will
befall
thee
that
happened
in
the
case
of
the
ass
and
the
bull
and
the
husbandmanâand
what
she
asked
was
that
o
my
father

the
wezeer
and
his
two
daughters
know
o
my
daughter
said
the
wezeer
that
there
was
a
certain
merchant
who
possessed
wealth
and
cattle
and
had
a
wife
and
children
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
had
also
endowed
him
with
the
knowledge
of
the
languages
of
beasts
and
birds30
the
abode
of
this
merchant
was
in
the
country
and
he
had
in
his
house
an
ass
and
a
bull31
when
the
bull
came
to
the
place
where
the
ass
was
tied
he
found
it
swept
and
sprinkled32
in
his
manger
were
sifted
barley
and
sifted
cut
straw33
and
the
ass
was
lying
at
his
ease
his
master
being
accustomed
only
to
ride
him
occasionally
when
business
required
and
soon
to
return
and
it
happened
one11
day
that
the
merchant
overheard
the
bull
saying
to
the
ass
may
thy
food
benefit
thee34
i
am
oppressed
with
fatigue
while
thou
art
enjoying
repose
thou
eatest
sifted
barley
and
men
serve
thee
and
it
is
only
occasionally
that
thy
master
rides
thee
and
returns
while
i
am
continually
employed
in
ploughing
and
turning
the
mill35âthe
ass
answered36
when
thou
goest
out
to
the
field
and
they
place
the
yoke
upon
thy
neck
lie
down
and
do
not
rise
again
even
if
they
beat
thee
or
if
thou
rise
lie
down
a
second
time
and
when
they
take
thee
back
and
place
the
beans
before
thee
eat
them
not
as
though
thou
wert
sick
abstain
from
eating
and
drinking
a
day
or
two
days
or
three
and
so
shalt
thou
find
rest
from
trouble
and
labourâaccordingly
when
the
driver
came
to
the
bull
with
his
fodder
he
ate
scarcely
any
of
it
and
on
the
morrow
when
the
driver
came
again
to
take
him
to
plough
he
found
him
apparently
quite
infirm
so
the
merchant
said
take
the
ass
and
make
him
draw
the
plough
in
his
stead
all
the
day
the
man
did
so
and
when
the
ass
returned
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
bull
thanked
him
for
the12
favour
he
had
conferred
upon
him
by
relieving
him
of
his
trouble
on
that
day
but
the
ass
returned
him
no
answer
for
he
repented
most
grievously
on
the
next
day
the
ploughman
came
again
and
took
the
ass
and
ploughed
with
him
till
evening
and
the
ass
returned
with
his
neck
flayed
by
the
yoke
and
reduced
to
an
extreme
state
of
weakness
and
the
bull
looked
upon
him
and
thanked
and
praised
him
the
ass
exclaimed
i
was
living
at
ease
and
nought
but
my
meddling
hath
injured
me
then
said
he
to
the
bull
know
that
i
am
one
who
would
give
thee
good
advice
i
heard
our
master
say
if
the
bull
rise
not
from
his
place
take
him
to
the
butcher
that
he
may
kill
him
and
make
a
naááº37
of
his
skinâi
am
therefore
in
fear
for
thee
and
so
i
have
given
thee
advice
and
peace
be
on
theeâwhen
the
bull
heard
these
words
of
the
ass
he
thanked
him
and
said
to-morrow
i
will
go
with
alacrityâso
he
ate
the
whole
of
his
fodder
and
even
licked
the
mangerâtheir
master
meanwhile
was
listening
to
their
conversation

the
ass
at
plough
on
the
following
morning
the
merchant
and
his
wife
went
to
the
bulls
crib
and
sat
down
there
and
the
driver
came
and
took
out
the
bull
and
when
the
bull
saw
his
master
he
shook
his
tail
and
showed
his
alacrity
by
sounds
and
actions
bounding
about
in
such
a
manner
that
the
merchant
laughed
until
he
fell
backwards
his
wife
in
surprise
asked
him
at
what
dost
thou
laugh
he
answered
at
a
thing
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
but
i
cannot
reveal
it
for
if
i
did
i
should
die
she
said
thou
must
inform
me
of
the
cause
of
thy
laughter
even
if
thou
dieâi
cannot
reveal
it
said
he
the
fear
of
death
prevents
meâthou
laughedst
only
at
me
she
said
and
she
ceased
not
to
urge
and
importune
him
until
he
was
quite
overcome
and
distracted
so
he
called
together
his
children
and
sent
for
the
áÃáee38
and
witnesses
that
he
might
make
his
will
and
reveal
the
secret
to
her
and
die
for
he
loved
her
excessively
since
she
was
the
daughter
of
his
paternal
uncle
and
the
mother
of
his
children
and
he
had
lived
with
her
to
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
years39
having
assembled
her
family
and
his
neighbours
he
related
to
them
his
story
and
told
them
that
as
soon
as
he
revealed
his
secret
he
must
die
upon
which
every
one
present
said
to
her
we
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
give
up
this
affair
and
let
not
thy
husband13
and
the
father
of
thy
children
die
but
she
said
i
will
not
desist
until
he
tell
me
though
he
die
for
it
so
they
ceased
to
solicit
her
and
the
merchant
left
them
and
went
to
the
stable
to
perform
the
ablution
and
then
to
return
and
tell
them
the
secret
and
die40

the
dog
and
the
cock
now
he
had
a
cock
with
fifty
hens
under
him
and
he
had
also
a
dog
and
he
heard
the
dog
call
to
the
cock
and
reproach
him
saying
art
thou
happy
when
our
master
is
going
to
die
the
cock
asked
how
soâand
the
dog
related
to
him
the
story
upon
which
the
cock
exclaimed
by
allah
our
master
has
little
sense
i
have
fifty
wives
and
i
please
this
and
provoke
that
while
he
has
but
one
wife
and
cannot
manage
this
affair
with
her
why
does
he
not
take
some
twigs
of
the
mulberry-tree
and
enter
her
chamber
and
beat
her
until
she
dies
or
repents
she
would
never
after
that
ask
him
a
question
respecting
anythingâand
when
the
merchant
heard
the
words
of
the
cock
as
he
addressed
the
dog
he
recovered
his
reason
and
made
up
his
mind
to
beat
herânow
said
the
wezeer
to
his
daughter
shahrazÃd
perhaps
i
may
do
to
thee
as
the
merchant
did
to
his
wife
she
asked
and
what
did
he
he
answered
he
entered
her
chamber
after
he
had
cut
off
some
twigs
of
the
mulberry-tree
and
hidden
them
there
and
then
said
to
her
come
into
the
chamber
that
i
may
tell
thee
the
secret
while
no
one
sees
me
and
then
dieâand
when
she
had
entered
he
locked
the
chamber-door
upon
her
and
beat
her
until
she
became
almost
senseless
and
cried
out
i
repentâand
she
kissed
his
hands
and
his
feet
and
repented
and
went
out
with
him
and
all
the
company
and
her
own
family
rejoiced
and
they
lived
together
in
the
happiest
manner
until
death

when
the
wezeers
daughter
heard
the
words
of
her
father
she
said
to
him
it
must
be
as
i
have
requested
so
he
arrayed
her
and
went
to
the
king
shahriyÃr
now
she
had
given
directions
to
her
young
sister
saying
to
her
when
i
have
gone
to
the
king
i
will
send
to
request
thee
to
come
and
when
thou
comest
to
me
and
seest
a
convenient
time
do
thou
say
to
me
o
my
sister
relate
to
me
some
strange
story
to
beguile
our
waking
hour41âand
i
will
relate
to
thee
a
story
that
shall
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
be
the
means
of
procuring
deliverance

her
father
the
wezeer
then
took
her
to
the
king
who
when14
he
saw
him
was
rejoiced
and
said
hast
thou
brought
me
what
i
desired
he
answered
yes
when
the
king
therefore
introduced
himself
to
her
she
wept
and
he
said
to
her
what
aileth
thee
she
answered
o
king
i
have
a
young
sister
and
i
wish
to
take
leave
of
her
so
the
king
sent
to
her
and
she
came
to
her
sister
and
embraced
her
and
sat
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
after
she
had
waited
for
a
proper
opportunity
she
said
by
allah
o
my
sister
relate
to
us
a
story
to
beguile
the
waking
hour
of
our
night
most
willingly
answered
shahrazÃd
if
this
virtuous
king
permit
me
and
the
king
hearing
these
words
and
being
restless
was
pleased
with
the
idea
of
listening
to
the
story
and
thus
on
the
first
night
of
the
thousand
and

of

note

to
the
introduction

note
1âon
the
initial
phrase
and
on
the
mohammadan
religion
and
laws
it
is
a
universal
custom
of
the
muslims
to
write
this
phrase
at
the
commencement
of
every
book
whatever
may
be
the
subject
and
to
pronounce
it
on
commencing
every
lawful
act
of
any
importance
this
they
do
in
imitation
of
the
áur-Ãn
every
chapter
of
which
excepting
one
is
thus
prefaced
and
in
accordance
with
a
precept
of
their
prophet
the
words
which
i
translate
compassionate
and
merciful
are
both
derived
from
the
same
root
and
have
nearly
the
same
meaning
the
one
being
of
a
form
which
is
generally
used
to
express
an
accidental
or
occasional
passion
or
sensation
the
other
to
denote
a
constant
quality
but
the
most
learned
of
the
ulamÃ

or
professors
of
religion
and
law
c
interpret
the
former
as
signifying
merciful
in
great
things
and
the
latter
merciful
in
small
things
sale
has
erred
in
rendering
them
conjunctly
most
merciful

in
the
books
of
the
muslims
the
first
words
after
the
above
phrase
almost
always
consist
as
in
the
work
before
us
of
some
form
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
god
for
his
power
and
goodness
followed
by
an
invocation
of
blessing
on
the
prophet
and
in
general
when
the
author
is
not
very
concise
in
these
expressions
he
conveys
in
them
some
allusion
to
the
subject
of
his
book
for
instance
if
he
write
on
marriage
he
will
commence
his
work
with
some
such
form
as
this
after
the
phrase
first
mentionedâpraise
be
to
god
who
hath
created
the
human
race
and
made
them
males
and
females
c

the
exordium
of
the
present
work
showing
the
duty
imposed
upon
a
muslim
by
his
religion
even
on
the
occasion
of
his
commencing
the
composition
or
compilation
of
a
series
of
fictions
suggests
to
me
the
necessity
of
inserting
a
brief
prefatory
notice
of
the
fundamental
points
of
his
faith
and
the
principal
laws
of
the
ritual
and
moral
the
civil
and
the
criminal
code
leaving
more
full
explanations
of
particular
points
to
be
given
when
occasions
shall
require
such
illustrations

the
confession
of
the
muslims
faith
is
briefly
made
in
these
wordsâthere
is
no
deity
but
god
moáammad
is
gods
apostleâwhich
imply
a
belief
and
observance
of
everything
that
moáammad
taught
to
be
the
word
or
will
of
god
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
are
commonly
called
orthodox
and
termed
sunnees
the
only
class
whom
we
have
to
consider
for
they
are
sunnee
tenets
and
arab
manners
which
are
described
in
this
work
in
almost
every
case
wherever
the
scene
is
laid
the
mohammadan
code
is
founded
upon
the
áur-Ãn
the
traditions
of
the
prophet
the
concordance
of
his
principal
early
disciples
and
the
decisions
which
have
been
framed
from
analogy
or
comparison
this
class
consists
of
four
sects
áanafees
shÃfeees
mÃlikees
and
áambelees
so
called
after
the
names
of
their
respective
founders
the
other
sects16
who
are
called
shiyaees
an
appellation
particularly
given
to
the
persian
sect
but
also
used
to
designate
generally
all
who
are
not
sunnees
are
regarded
by
their
opponents
in
general
nearly
in
the
same
light
as
those
who
do
not
profess
el-islÃm
or
the
mohammadan
faith
that
is
as
destined
to
eternal
or
severe
punishment

the
mohammadan
faith
embraces
the
following
points

1
belief
in
god
who
is
without
beginning
or
end
the
sole
creator
and
lord
of
the
universe
having
absolute
power
and
knowledge
and
glory
and
perfection

2
belief
in
his
angels
who
are
impeccable
beings
created
of
light
and
genii
jinn
who
are
peccable
created
of
smokeless
fire
the
devils
whose
chief
is
iblees
or
satan
are
evil
genii

3
belief
in
his
scriptures
which
are
his
uncreated
word
revealed
to
his
prophets
of
these
there
now
exist
but
held
to
be
greatly
corrupted
the
pentateuch
of
moses
the
psalms
of
david
and
the
gospels
of
jesus
christ
and
in
an
uncorrupted
and
incorruptible
state
the
áur-Ãn
which
is
held
to
have
abrogated
and
to
surpass
in
excellence
all
preceding
revelations

4
belief
in
his
prophets
and
apostles12
the
most
distinguished
of
whom
are
adam
noah
abraham
moses
jesus
and
moáammad
jesus
is
held
to
be
more
excellent
than
any
of
those
who
preceded
him
to
have
been
born
of
a
virgin
and
to
be
the
messiah
and
the
word
of
god
and
a
spirit
proceeding
from
him
but
not
partaking
of
his
essence
and
not
to
be
called
the
son
of
god
moáammad
is
held
to
be
more
excellent
than
all
the
last
and
greatest
of
prophets
and
apostles
the
most
excellent
of
the
creatures
of
god

5
belief
in
the
general
resurrection
and
judgment
and
in
future
rewards
and
punishments
chiefly
of
a
corporeal
nature
that
the
punishments
will
be
eternal
to
all
but
wicked
mohammadans
and
that
none
but
mohammadans
will
enter
into
a
state
of
happiness

6
belief
in
gods
predestination
of
all
events
both
good
and
evil

the
principal
ritual
and
moral
laws
are
on
the
following
subjects
of
which
the
first
four
are
the
most
important

1
prayer
eá-áalÃh
commonly
pronounced
eá-áalah
including
preparatory
purifications
there
are
partial
or
total
washings
to
be
performed
on
particular
occasions
which
need
not
be
mentioned
the
ablution
which
is
more
especially
preparatory
to
prayer
and
which
is
called
wuáoÃ
consists
in
washing
the
hands
mouth
nostrils
face
arms
as
high
as
the
elbow
the
right
first
each
three
times
and
then
the
upper
part
of
the
head
the
beard
ears
neck
and
feet
each
once
this
is
done
with
running
water
or
from
a
very
large
tank
or
from
a
lake
or
the
seaâprayers
are
required
to
be
performed
five
times
in
the
course
of
every
day
between
daybreak
and
sunrise
between
noon
and
the
aár
which
latter
period
is
about
mid-time
between
noon
and
nightfall
between
the
aár
and
sunset
between
sunset
and
the
eshÃ
or
the
period
when
the
darkness
of
night
commences
and
at
or
after
the
eshÃ
the
commencement
of
each
of
these
periods
is
announced
by
a
chant
called
adÃn
repeated
by
a
crier
muÃddin
from
the
mÃdneh
or
menaret
of
each
mosque
and
it
is
more
meritorious
to
commence
the
prayer
then
than
at
a
later
time
on
each
of
these
occasions
the
muslim
has
to
perform
certain
prayers
held
to
be
ordained
by
god
and
others
ordained
by
the
prophet
each
kind
consisting
of
two
three
or
four
rekahs
which
term
signifies
the
repetition
of
a
set
form
of
words
chiefly
from
the
áur-Ãn
and
ejaculations
of
god
is
most
great
c
accompanied
by
particular
postures
part
of
the
words
being
repeated
in
an
erect
posture
part
sitting
and
part
in
other
postures
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
body
followed
by
two
prostrations
distinguishing
each
rekah
these
prayers
may
in
some
cases
be
abridged
and
in
others
entirely
omitted
other
prayers
must
be
performed
on
particular
occasions
1
on
friday
the
mohammadan
sabbath
these
are
congregational
prayers
and
are
similar
to
those
of
other
17days
with
additional
prayers
and
exhortations
by
a
minister
who
is
called
imÃm
or
khaáeeb
2
on
two
grand
annual
festivals

of
the
senses
every

the
same
part

this
festival
is
observed
otherwise
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
minor
one
above
mentioned
and
lasts
three
or
four
days

the
less
important
ritual
and
moral
laws
may
here
be
briefly
mentioned
in
a
single
paragraphâone
of
these
is
circumcision
which
is
not
absolutely
obligatoryâthe
distinctions
of
clean
and
unclean
meats
are
nearly
the
same
in
the
mohammedan
as
in
the
mosaic
code
camels
flesh
is
an
exception
being
lawful
to
the
muslim
swines
flesh
and
blood
are
especially
condemned
and
a
particular
mode
of
slaughtering
animals
for
food
is
enjoined
accompanied
by
the
repetition
of
the
name
of
godâwine
and
all
inebriating
liquors
are
strictly
forbiddenâso
also
are
gaming
and
usuryâmusic
is
condemned
but
most
muslims
take
great
delight
in
hearing
itâimages
and
pictures
representing
living
creatures
are
contrary
to
lawâcharity
probity
in
all
transactions
veracity
excepting
in
a
few
cases
and
modesty
are
virtues
indispensableâcleanliness
in
person
and
decent
attire
are
particularly
required
clothes
of
silk
and
ornaments
of
gold
or
silver
are
forbidden
to
men
but
allowed
to
women
this
precept
however
is
often
disregardedâutensils
of
gold
and
silver
are
also
condemned
yet
they
are
used
by
many
muslimsâthe
manners
of
muslims
in
society
are
subject
to
particular
laws
or
rules
with
respect
to
salutations
c

of
the
civil
laws
the
following
notices
will
at
present
sufficeâa
man
may
have
four
wives
at
the
same
time
and
according
to
common
opinion
as
many
concubine
slaves
as
he
pleasesâhe
may
divorce
a
wife
twice
and
each
time
take
her
back
again
but
if
he
divorce
her
a
third
time
or
by
a
triple
sentence
he
cannot
make
her
his
wife
again
unless
by
her
own
consent
and
by
a
new
contract
and
after
another
man
has
consummated
a
marriage
with
her
and
divorced
herâthe
children
by
a
wife
and
those
by
a
concubine
slave
inherit
equally
if
the
latter
be
acknowledged
by
the
father
sons
inherit
equally
so
also
do
daughters
but
the
share
of
a
daughter
is
half
that
of
a
son
one-eighth
is
the
share
of
the
wife
or
wives
of
the
deceased
if
he
have
left
issue
and
one-fourth
if
he
have
left
no
issue
a
husband
inherits
one-fourth
of
his
wifes
property
if
she
have
left
issue
and
one-half
if
she
have
left
no
issue
the
debts
and
legacies
of
the
deceased
must
be
first
paid
a
man
may
leave
one-third
of
his
property
in
any
way
he
pleasesâwhen
a
concubine
slave
has
borne
a
child
to
her
master
she
becomes
entitled
to
freedom
on
his
deathâthere
are
particular
laws
relating
to
commerce
usury
and
monopoly
are
especially
condemned

18
of
the
criminal
laws
a
few
only
need
here
be
mentioned
murder
is
punishable
by
death
or
by
a
fine
to
be
paid
to
the
family
of
the
deceased
if
they
prefer
itâtheft
if
the
property
stolen
amount
to
a
quarter
of
a
deenÃr
is
to
be
punished
by
cutting
off
the
right
hand
except
under
certain
circumstancesâadultery
if
attested
by
four
eye-witnesses
is
punishable
by
death
stoning
fornication
by
a
hundred
stripes
and
banishment
for
a
yearâdrunkenness
is
punished
with
eighty
stripesâapostasy
persevered
in
by
death

note
2âon
the
arabian
system
of
cosmography
the
words
translated
as
a
bed
would
be
literally
rendered
and
the
bed
but
the
signification
is
that
which
i
have
expressed
see
the
áur-Ãn
ch

and
with

these
and
the
preceding
words
commencing
with
the
beneficent
king
i
have
introduced
in
the
place
of
the
lord
of
all
creatures
from
the
calcutta
edition
of
the
first
two
hundred
nights
as
affording
me
an
opportunity
to
explain
here
the
arabian
system
of
cosmography
with
which
the
reader
of
this
work
cannot
be
too
early
acquainted

when
we
call
to
mind
how
far
the
arabs
surpassed
their
great
master
aristotle
in
natural
and
experimental
philosophy
and
remember
that
their
brilliant
discoveries
constituted
an
important
link
between
those
of
the
illustrious
greek
and
of
our
equally
illustrious
countryman
roger
bacon
their
popular
system
of
cosmography
becomes
an
interesting
subject
for
our
consideration

according
to
the
common
opinion
of
the
arabs
an
opinion
sanctioned
by
the
áur-Ãn
and
by
assertions
of
their
prophet
which
almost
all
muslims
take
in
their
literal
sense
there
are
seven
heavens
one
above
another
and
seven
earths
one
beneath
another
the
earth
which
we
inhabit
being
the
highest
of
the
latter
and
next
below
the
lowest
heaven
the
upper
surface
of
each
heaven
and
that
of
each
earth
are
believed
to
be
nearly
plane
and
are
generally
supposed
to
be
circular
and
are
said
to
be
five
hundred
years
journey
in
width
this
is
also
said
to
be
the
measure
of
the
depth
or
thickness
of
each
heaven
and
each
earth
and
of
the
distance
between
each
heaven
or
earth
and
that
next
above
or
below
it
thus
is
explained
a
passage
of
the
áur-Ãn
ch
lxv
last
verse
in
which
it
is
said
that
god
hath
created
seven
heavens
and
as
many
earths
or
stories
of
the
earth
in
accordance
with
traditions
from
the
prophet14âthis
notion
of
the
seven
heavens
appears
to
have
been
taken
from
the
seven
spheres
the
first
of
which
is
that
of
the
moon
the
second
of
mercury
the
third
of
venus
the
fourth
of
the
sun
the
fifth
of
mars
the
sixth
of
jupiter
and
the
seventh
of
saturn
each
of
which
orbs
was
supposed
to
revolve
round
the
earth
in
its
proper
sphere
so
also
the
idea
of
the
seven
earths
seems
to
have
been
taken
from
the
division
of
the
earth
into
seven
climates
a
division
which
has
been
adopted
by
several
arab
geographersâbut
to
return
to
the
opinions
of
the
religious
and
the
vulgar

traditions
differ
respecting
the
fabric
of
the
seven
heavens
in
the
most
credible
account
according
to
a
celebrated
historian
the
first
is
described
as
formed
of
emerald
the
second
of
white
silver
the
third
of
large
white
pearls
the
fourth
of
ruby
the
fifth
of
red
gold
the
sixth
of
yellow
jacinth
and
the
seventh
of
shining
light15

19some
assert
paradise
to
be
in
the
seventh
heaven
and
indeed
i
have
found
this
to
be
the
general
opinion
of
my
muslim
friends
but
the
author
above
quoted
proceeds
to
describe
next
above
the
seventh
heaven

several

of

are
described
in
some
traditions
as
forming
so
many
degrees

ascended
by

though
the
opinion
before
mentioned
respecting
the
form
of
the
earth
which
we
inhabit
is
that
generally
maintained
by
the
arabs
there
have
been
and
still
are
many
philosophical
men
among
this
people
who
have
argued
that
it
is
a
globe
because
as
el-áazweenee
says
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
has
been
observed
to
happen
at
different
hours
of
the
night
in
eastern
and
western
countries
thus
we
find
ptolemys
measurement
of
the
earth
quoted
and
explained
by
ibn-el-wardeeâthe
circumference
of
the
earth
is
24000

the

of

and
its
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
with
their
day
of
six
months
and

of

and
their
frozen
waters
c

for
ourselves
however
it
is
necessary
that
we
retain
in
our
minds
the
opinions
first
stated
with
regard
to
the
form
and
dimensions
of
our
earth
agreeing
with
those
muslims
who
allow
not
philosophy
to
trench
upon
revelation
or
sacred
traditions
it
is
written
say
they
that
god
hath
spread
out
the
earth18
as
a
bed19
and
as
a
carpet20
and
what
is
round
or
globular
cannot
be
said
to
be
spread
out
nor
compared
to
a
bed
or
a
carpet
it
is
therefore
decided
to
be
an
almost
plane
expanse
the
continents
and
islands
of
the
earth
are
believed
by
the
arabs
as
they
were
by
the
greeks
in
the
age
of
homer
and
hesiod
to
be
surrounded
by
the
circumambient
ocean
el-baár
el-moáeeá
and
this
ocean
is
described
as
bounded
by
a
chain
of
mountains
called
kÃf
which
encircle
the
whole
as
a
ring
and
confine
and
strengthen
the
entire
fabric
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
the
earth
our
faith
must
at
least
admit
the
assertion
of
the
prophet
that
its
width
as
well
as
its
depth
or
thickness
is
equal
to
five
hundred
years
journey
allotting
the
space
of
two
hundred
to
the
sea
two
hundred
to
uninhabited
desert
eighty
to
the
country
of
yÃjooj
and
mÃjooj
or
gog
and
magog
and
the
rest
to
the
remaining
creatures21
nay
vast
as
these
limits
are
we
must
rather
extend
than
contract
them
unless
we
suppose
some
of
the
heroes
of
this
work
to
travel
by
circuitous
routes
another
tradition
will
suit
us
better
wherein
it
is
said
that
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
earth
is
with
respect
to
the
rest
as
a
tent
in
the
midst
of
a
desert22
but
even
according
to
the
former
assertion
it
will
be
remarked
that
the
countries
now
commonly
known
to
the
arabs
from
the
western
extremity
of
africa
to
the
eastern
limits
of
india
and
from
the
southern
confines
of
abyssinia

those

says

as

perhaps
the

takes

in

according
to

is

drank

which
he
still
lives

will
live
till
the
day
of
judgment
this
mysterious
person
whom
the
vulgar
and
some
others
regard
as
a
prophet
and
identify
with
ilyÃs
elias
or
elijah
and
whom
some
confound
with
st
george
was
according
to
the
more
approved
opinion
of
the
learned
a
just
man
or
saint
the
wezeer
and
counsellor
of
the
first
zu-l-áarneyn
who
was
a
universal
conqueror
but
an
equally
doubtful
personage
contemporary
with
the
patriarch
ibrÃheem
or
abraham
el-khiár
is
said
to
appear
frequently
to
muslims
in
perplexity
and
to
be
generally
clad
in
green
garments
whence
according
to
some
his
name
the
prophet
ilyÃs
or
elias
is
also
related
to
have
drunk
of
the
fountain
of
life
during
the
day-time
it
is
said
el-khiár
wanders
upon
the
seas
and
directs
voyagers
who
go
astray
while
ilyÃs
perambulates
the
mountains
or
deserts
and
directs
persons
who
chance
to
be
led
astray
by
the
ghools24
but
at
night
they
meet
together
and
guard
the
rampart
of
yÃjooj
and
mÃjooj25
to
prevent
these
people
from
making
irruptions
upon
their
neighbours
both
however
are
generally
believed
by
the
modern
muslims
to
assist
pious
persons
in
distress
in
various
circumstances
whether
travelling
by
land
or
by
waterâthe
mountains
of
áÃf
which
bound
the
circumambient
ocean
and
form
a
circular
barrier
round
the
whole
of
our
earth
are
described
by
interpreters
of
the
áur-Ãn
as
composed
of
green
chrysolite
like
the
green
tint
of
the
sky26
it
is
the
colour
of
these
mountains
said
the
prophet
that
imparts
a
greenish
hue
to
the
sky27
it
is
said
in
a
tradition
that
beyond
these
mountains
are
other
countries
one
of
gold
seventy
of
silver
and
seven
of
musk
all
inhabited
by
angels
and
each
country
ten
thousand
years
journey
in
length
and
the
same
in
breadth28
some
say
that
21beyond
it
are
creatures
unknown
to
any
but
god29
but
the
general
opinion
is
that
the
mountains
of
áÃf
terminate
our
earth
and
that
no
one
knows
what
is
beyond
them
they
are
the
chief
abode
of
the
jinn
or
geniiâsuch
is
a
concise
account
of
the
earth
which
we
inhabit
according
to
the
notions
of
the
arabs

we
must
now
describe
what
is
beneath
our
earthâit
has
already
been
said
that
this
is
the
first
or
highest
of
seven
earths
which
are
all
of
equal
width
and
thickness
and
at
equal
distances
apart
each
of
these
earths
has
occupants
the
occupants
of
the
first
are
men
genii
brutes
c
the
second
is
occupied
by
the
suffocating
wind
that
destroyed
the
infidel
tribe
of
Ãd
the
third
by
the
stones
of
jahennem
or
hell
mentioned
in
the
áur-Ãn
in
these
words
the
fuel
of
which
is
men
and
stones30
the
fourth
by
the
sulphur
of
jahennem
the
fifth
by
its
serpents
the
sixth
by
its
scorpions
in
colour
and
size
like
black
mules
and
with
tails
like
spears
the
seventh
by
iblees
and
his
troops31
whether
these
several
earths
are
believed
to
be
connected
with
each
other
by
any
means
and
if
so
how
we
are
not
expressly
informed
but
that
they
are
supposed
to
be
so
is
evident
with
respect
to
our
earth
in
particular
as
some
think
it
is
said
that
it
is
supported
by
a
rock
with
which
the
mountains
of
áÃf
communicate
by
means
of
veins
or
roots
and
that
when
god
desires
to
effect
an
earthquake
at
a
certain
place
he
commands
the
mountain
or
rock
to
agitate
the
vein
that
is
connected
with
that
place32âbut
there
is
another
account
describing
our
earth
as
upheld
by
certain
successive
supports
of
inconceivable
magnitude
which
are
under
the
seventh
earth
leaving
us
to
infer
that
the
seven
earths
are
in
some
manner
connected
together
this
account
as
inserted
in
the
work
of
one
of
the
writers
above
quoted
is
as
followsâthe
earth
under
which
appellation
are
here
understood
the
seven
earths
was
it
is
said
originally
unstable
therefore
god
created
an
angel
of
immense
size
and
of
the
utmost
strength
and
ordered
him
to
go
beneath
it
ie
beneath
the
lowest
earth
and
place
it
on
his
shoulders
and
his
hands
extended
beyond
the
east
and
west
and
grasped
the
extremities
of
the
earth
or
as
related
in
ibn-el-wardee
the
seven
earths
and
held
it
or
them
but
there
was
no
support
for
his
feet
so
god
created
a
rock
of
ruby
in
which
were
seven
thousand
perforations
and
from
each
of
these
perforations
issued
a
sea
the
size
of
which
none
knoweth
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
then
he
ordered
this
rock
to
stand
under
the
feet
of
the
angel
but
there
was
no
support
for
the
rock
wherefore
god
created
a
huge
bull
with
four
thousand
eyes
and
the
same
number
of
ears
noses
mouths
tongues
and
feet
between
every
two
of
which
was
a
distance
of
five
hundred
years
journey
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
ordered
this
bull
to
go
beneath
the
rock
and
he
bore
it
on
his
back
and
his
horns
the
name
of
this
bull
is
kuyootÃ
33
but
there
was
no
support
for
the
bull
therefore
god
whose
name
be
exalted
created
an
enormous
fish
that
no
one
could
look
upon
on
account
of
its
vast
size
and
the
flashing
of
its
eyes
and
their
greatness
for
it
is
said
that
if
all
the
seas
were
placed
in
one
of
its
nostrils
they
would
appear
like
a
grain
of
mustard-seed
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
commanded
the
fish
to
be
a
support
to
the
feet
of
the
bull34
the
name
of
this
fish
in
bahamoot
he
placed
as
its
support
water
and
under
the
water
darkness
and
the
knowledge
of
mankind
22fails
as
to
what
is
under
the
darkness35âanother
opinion
is
that
the
seventh
earth
is
upon
water
the
water
upon
the
rock
the
rock
on
the
back
of
the
bull
the
bull
on
a
bed
of
sand
the
sand
on
the
fish
the
fish
upon
a
still
suffocating
wind
the
wind
on
a
veil
of
darkness
the
darkness
on
a
mist
and
what
is
beneath
the
mist
is
unknown36

it
is
generally
believed
that
under
the
lowest
earth
and
beneath
seas
of
darkness
of
which
the
number
is
unknown
is
hell
which
consists
of
seven
stages
one
beneath
another
the
first
of
these
according
to
the
general
opinion
is
destined
for
the
reception
of
wicked
mohammadans
the
second
for
the
christians
the
third
for
the
jews
the
fourth
for
the
sabians
the
fifth
for
the
magians
the
sixth
for
the
idolaters
the
seventh
by
general
consent
for
the
hypocrites
jahennem
is
the
general
name
for
hell
and
the
particular
name
for
its
first
stage
the
situation
of
hell
has
been
a
subject
of
dispute
some
place
it
in
the
seventh
earth
and
some
have
doubted
whether
it
be
above
or
below
the
earth
which
we
inhabit

at
the
consummation
of
all
things
god
we
are
told
will
take
the
whole
earth
in
his
left
hand
and
the
heavens
will
be
rolled
together
in
his
right
hand37
and
the
earth
will
be
changed
into
another
earth
and
the
heavens
into
other
heavens38
and
hell
will
be
brought
nigh
to
the
tribunal
of
god39

note

the
phrase
god
is
all-knowing
or
surpassing
in
knowledge
or
as
some
say
simply
knowing
is
generally
used
by
an
arab
writer
when
he
relates
anything
for
the
truth
of
which
he
cannot
vouch
and
muslims
often
use
it
in
conversation
in
similar
cases
unless
when
they
are
uttering
intentional
falsehoods
which
most
of
them
are
in
the
frequent
habit
of
doing
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
though
falsehood
is
permitted
by
their
religion
in
some
cases
their
doctors
of
religion
and
law
generally
condemn
all
works
of
fiction
even
though
designed
to
convey
useful
instruction
excepting
mere
fables
or
apologues
of
a
high
class

there
are
three
opinions
respecting
the
etymology
of

some
derive
it
from
wizr
a
burden
because
the
wezeer
bears
the
burdens
of

others
from

a
refuge
because
the

the
counsels
of
his
wezeer
and
his
knowledge
and
prudence
others
again
from
azr
back
or
23strength
because
the
king
is
strengthened
by
his
wezeer
as
the
human
frame
is
by
the
back40

the
proper
and
chief
duties
of
a
wezeer
are
explained
by
the
above
and
by
a
saying
of
the
prophetâwhosoever
is
in
authority
over
muslims
if
god
would
prosper
him
he
giveth
him
a
virtuous
wezeer
who
when
he
forgetteth
his
duty
remindeth
him
and
when
he
remembereth
assisteth
him
but
if
he
would
do
otherwise
he
giveth
him
an
evil
wezeer
who
when
he
forgetteth
doth
not
remind
him
and
when
he
remembereth
doth
not
assist
him41

the
post
of
wezeer
was
the
highest
that
was
held
by
an
officer
of
the
pen
and
the
person
who
occupied
it
was
properly
the
next
to
the
suláÃn
but
the
turkish
suláÃns
of
egypt
made
the
office
of
nÃÃb
or
viceroy
to
have
the
pre-eminence
under
them
the
post
of
wezeer
was
sometimes
occupied
by
an
officer
of
the
sword
and
sometimes
by
an
officer
of
the
pen
and
in
both
cases
the
wezeer
was
also
called
the
áÃáeb
the
suláÃn
baráooá
so
degraded
this
office
by
intrusting
its
most
important
functions
to
other
ministers
that
the
wezeer
became
in
reality
the
kings
purveyor
and
little
else
receiving
the
indirect
taxes
and
employing
them
in
the
purchase
of
provisions
for
the
royal
kitchen42
it
is
even
said
that
he
was
usually
chosen
by
the
turkish
suláÃns
of
egypt
from
among
the
copts
or
christian
egyptians
because
the
administration
of
the
taxes
had
from
time
immemorial
been
committed
to
persons
of
that
race43
this
it
would
seem
was
the
case
about
the
time
of
the
suláÃn
baráooá
but
in
the
present
work
we
are
to
understand
the
office
of
wezeer
as
being
what
it
was
in
earlier
timesâthat
of
prime
minister
though
we
are
not
hence
to
infer
that
the
editions
of
the
tales
of
a
thousand
and
one
nights
known
to
us
were
written
at
a
period
anterior
to
that
of
the
memlook
suláÃns
of
egypt
and
syria
for
in
the
time
of
these
monarchs
the
degradation
of
the
office
was
commonly
known
to
be
a
recent
innovation
and
it
may
have
been
of
no
very
long
continuance

the
letters
of
muslims
the
letters
of
muslims
are
distinguished
by
several
peculiarities
dictated
by
the
rules
of
politeness
the
paper
is
thick
white
and
highly
polished
sometimes
it
is
ornamented
with
flowers
of
gold
and
the
edges
are
always
cut
straight
with
scissors
the
upper
half
is
generally
left
blank
and
the
writing
never
occupies
any
portion
of
the
second
side
a
notion
of
the
usual
style
of
letters
will
be
conveyed
by
several
examples
in
this
work
the
name
of
the
person
to
24whom
the
letter
is
addressed
when
the
writer
is
an
inferior
or
an
equal
and
even
in
some
other
cases
commonly
occurs
in
the
first
sentence
preceded
by
several
titles
of
honour
and
is
often
written
a
little
above
the
line
to
which
it
apertains
the
space
beneath
it
in
that
line
being
left
blank
sometimes
it
is
written
in
letters
of
gold
or
red
ink
a
king
writing
to
a
subject
or
a
great
man
to
a
dependent
usually
places
his
name
and
seal
at
the
head
of
his
letter
the
seal
is
the
impression
of
a
signet
generally
a
ring
worn
on
the
little
finger
of
the
right
hand
upon
which
is
engraved
the
name
of
the
person
commonly
accompanied
by
the
words
his
ie
gods
servant
or
some
other
words
expressive
of
trust
in
god
c
its
impression
is
considered
more
valid
than
the
sign-manual
and
is
indispensable
to
give
authenticity
to
the
letter
it
is
made
by
dabbing
some
ink
upon
the
surface
of
the
signet
and
pressing
this
upon
the
paper
the
place
which
is
to
be
stamped
being
first
moistened
by
touching
the
tongue
with
a
finger
of
the
right
hand
and
then
gently
rubbing
the
part
with
that
finger
a
person
writing
to
a
superior
or
to
an
equal
or
even
an
inferior
to
whom
he
wishes
to
shew
respect
signs
his
name
at
the
bottom
of
his
letter
next
the
left
side
or
corner
and
places
the
seal
immediately
to
the
right
of
this
but
if
he
particularly
desire
to
testify
his
humility
he
places
it
beneath
his
name
or
even
partly
over
the
lower
edge
of
the
paper
which
consequently
does
not
receive
the
whole
of
the
impression
the
letter
is
generally
folded
twice
in
the
direction
of
the
writing
and
enclosed
in
a
cover
of
paper
upon
which
is
written
the
address
in
some
such
form
as
thisâit
shall
arrive
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted

such
a
place

the
custom
of
sending
forth
a
deputation
to
meet
and
welcome
an
approaching
ambassador
or
other
great
man
is
still
observed
in
eastern
countries
and
the
rank
of
the
persons
thus
employed
conveys
to
him
some
intimation
of
the
manner
in
which
he
is
to
be
received
at
the
court
he
therefore
looks
forward
to
this
ceremony
with
a
degree
of
anxiety
a
humorous
illustration
of
its
importance

the
eye
of
an

13âon
hospitality
the
hospitable
custom
here
mentioned
is
observed
by
muslims
in
compliance
with
a
precept
of
their
prophet
whoever
said
he
believes
in
god
and
the
day
of
resurrection
must
respect
his
guest
and
the
time
of
being
kind
to
him
is
one
day
and
one
night
and
the
period
of
entertaining
him
is
three
days
and
after
that
if
he
does
it
longer
he
benefits
him
more
but
it
is
not
right
for
a
guest
to
stay
in
the
house
of
the
host
so
long
as
to
incommode
him
he
even
allowed
the
right
of
a
guest
to
be
taken
by
force
from
such
as
would
not
offer
it45
the
following
observations
respecting
the
treatment
of
guests
by
the
bedawees
present
an
interesting
commentary
upon
the
former
precept
and
upon
our
textâstrangers
who
have
not
any
friend
or
acquaintance
in
the
camp
alight
at
the
first
tent
that
presents
itself
whether
the
owner
be
at
home
or
not
the
wife
or
daughter
immediately
spreads
a
carpet
and
prepares
breakfast
or
dinner
if
the
strangers
business
requires
a
protracted
stay
as
for
instance
if
he
wishes
to
cross
the
desert
under
the
protection
of
the
tribe
the
host
after
a
lapse
of
three
days
and
four
hours
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
asks
whether
he
means
to
honour
him
any
longer
with
his
company
if
the
stranger
declares
his
intention
of
prolonging
his
visit
it
is
expected
that
he
should
assist
his
host
in
domestic
matters
fetching
water
milking
the
camel
feeding
the
horse
c
should
he
even
decline
this
he
may
remain
but
will
be
censured
by
all
the
arabs
of
the
camp
he
may
however
go
to
some
other
tent
of
the
nezel
or
encampment
and
declare
himself
there
a
guest
thus
every
third
or
fourth
day
he
25may
change
hosts
until
his
business
is
finished
or
he
has
reached
his
place
of
destination46

different
modes
of
obeisance
various
different
modes
of
obeisance
are
practised
by
the
muslims
among
these
the
following
are
the
more
common
or
more
remarkable
they
differ
in
the
degree
of
respect
that
they
indicate
nearly
in
the
order
in
which
i
shall
mention
them
the
last
being
the
most
respectfulâ1
placing
the
right
hand
upon
the
breastâ2
touching
the
lips
and
the
forehead
or
turban
or
the
forehead
or
turban
only
with
the
right
handâ3
doing
the
same
but
slightly
inclining
the
head
during
that
actionâ4
the
same
as
the
preceding
but
inclining
the
body
alsoâ5
as
above
but
previously
touching
the
ground
with
the
right
handâ6
kissing
the
hand
of
the
person
to
whom
the
obeisance
is
paidâ7
kissing
his
sleeveâ8
kissing
the
skirt
of
his
clothingâ9
kissing
his
feetâ10
kissing
the
carpet
or
ground
before
himâthe
first
five
modes
are
often
accompanied
by
the
salutation
of
peace
be
on
you
to
which
the
reply
is
on
you
be
peace
and
the
mercy
of
god
and
his
blessings
the
sixth
mode
is
observed
by
servants
or
pupils
to
masters
by
the
wife
to
the
husband
and
by
children
to
their
father
and
sometimes
to
the
mother
it
is
also
an
act
of
homage
paid
to
the
aged
by
the
young
or
to
learned
or
religious
men
by
the
less
instructed
or
less
devout
the
last
mode
is
seldom
observed
but
to
kings
and
in
arabian
countries
it
is
now
very
uncommon

note
15
it
might
seem
unnecessary
to
say
that
a
king
understood
what
he
read
were
it
not
explained
that
the
style
of
arabic
epistolary
compositions
like
that
of
the
literature
in

differs
considerably
from
that
of
common
conversation

the
inhabitants

the
shops

houses
are
painted
with
gay
coloursâtowards

shops
previously
to

arrival
of
ibrÃheem
bÃshÃ

in

alternate
horizontal
stripes

is
one
course
of

white
and
the
next
red
but
the
only
kind
of
oil-paint
that
they
could
procure
in
large
quantities
was
blue
the
colour
of
mourning
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
use
this
as
the
ground
upon
which
to
paint
flowers
and
other
ornamental
devices
on
their
shops
but
they
regarded
this
as
portending
a
pestilence

the
awful
plague
of
the

confirmed
them
in
their
superstitious
notions

the
opinions
of
the
arabs
respecting
female
beauty
the
reader
should
have
some
idea
of
the
qualifications
or
charms
which
the
arabs
in
general
consider
requisite
to
the
perfection
of
female
beauty
for
erroneous
fancies
on
this
subject
would
much
detract
from
the
interest
of
the
present
work
he
must
not
imagine
that
excessive
fatness
is
one
of
these
characteristics
though
it
is
said
to
be
esteemed
a
chief
essential
to
beauty
throughout
the
greater
part
of
northern
africa
on
the
contrary
the
maiden
whose
loveliness
inspires
the
most
impassioned
expressions
in
arabic
poetry
and
prose
is
celebrated
for
her
slender
figure
she
is
like
the
cane
among
plants
and
26is
elegant
as
a
twig
of
the
oriental
willow47
her
face
is
like
the
full
moon
presenting
the
strongest
contrast
to
the
colour
of
her
hair
which
to
preserve
the
nature
of
the
simile
just
employed
is
of
the
deepest
hue
of
night
and
descends
to
the
middle
of
her
back
a
rosy
blush
overspreads
the
centre
of
each
cheek
and
a
mole
is
considered
an
additional
charm
the
arabs
indeed
are
particularly
extravagant
in
their
admiration
of
this
natural
beauty-spot
which
according
to
its
place
is
compared
to
a
globule
of
ambergris
upon
a
dish
of
alabaster
or
upon
the
surface
of
a
ruby48
the
eyes
of
the
arab
beauty
are
intensely
black
large
and
long
of
the
form
of
an
almond
they
are
full
of
brilliancy
but
this
is
softened
by
a
lid
slightly
depressed
and
by
long
silken
lashes
giving
a
tender
and
languid
expression
which
is
full
of
enchantment
and
scarcely
to
be
improved
by
the
adventitious
aid
of
the
black
border
of
koál
for
this
the
lovely
maiden
adds
rather
for
the
sake
of
fashion
than
necessity

term

the
jinn
or
genii
the
frequent
mention
of
genii
in
this
work
and
the
erroneous
accounts
that
have
been
given
of
these
fabulous
beings
by
various
european
writers
have
induced
me
to
examine
the
statements
respecting
them
in
several
arabic
works
and
i
shall
here
offer
the
result
of
my
investigation
with
a
previous
account
of
the
angels

the
muslims
in
general
believe
in
three
different
species
of
created
intelligent
beings
namely
angels
who
are
created
of
light
genii
who
are
created
of
fire
and
men
created
of
earth
the
first
species
are
called
melÃikeh
sing
melek
the
second
jinn
or
ginn
sing
jinnee
or
ginnee
the
third
ins
sing
27insee
some
hold
that
the
devils
sheyáÃns
are
of
a
species
distinct
from
angels
and
jinn
but
the
more
prevailing
opinion
and
that
which
rests
on
the
highest
authority
is
that
they
are
rebellious
jinn

it
is
believed
says
el-áazweenee
that
the
angels
are
of
a
simple
substance
endowed
with
life
and
speech
and
reason
and
that
the
difference
between
them
and
the
jinn
and
sheyáÃns
is
a
difference
of
species
know
he
adds
that
the
angels
are
sanctified
from
carnal
desire
and
the
disturbance
of
anger
they
disobey
not
god
in
what
he
hath
commanded
them
but
do
what
they
are
commanded
their
food
is
the
celebrating
of
his
glory
their
drink
the
proclaiming
of
his
holiness
their
conversation
the
commemoration
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
their
pleasure
his
worship
they
are
created
in
different
forms
and
with
different
powers
some
are
described
as
having
the
forms
of
brutes
four
of
them
are
archangels
jebraeel
or
jibreel
or
gabriel
the
angel
of
revelations
meekaeel
or
meekÃl
or
michael
the
patron
of
the
israelites
azraeel
the
angel
of
death
and
isrÃfeel
the
angel
of
the
trumpet
which
he
is
to
sound
twice
or
as
some
say
thrice
at
the
end
of
the
world
one
blast
will
kill
all
living
creatures
himself
included
another
forty
years
after
he
being
raised
again
for
this
purpose
with
jebraeel
and
meekaeel
will
raise
the
dead
these
archangels
are
also
called
apostolic
angels
they
are
inferior
in
dignity
to
human
prophets
and
apostles
though
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
human
race
the
angelic
nature
is
held
to
be
inferior
to
the
human
nature
because
all
the
angels
were
commanded
to
prostrate
themselves
before
adam
every
believer
is
attended
by
two
guardian
and
recording
angels
one
of
whom
writes
his
good
actions
the
other
his
evil
actions
or
according
to
some
the
number
of
these
angels
is
five
or
sixty
or
a
hundred
and
sixty
there
are
also
two
angels
called
munkar
vulg
nÃkir
and
nekeer
who
examine
all
the
dead
and
torture
the
wicked
in
their
graves

the
species
of
jinn
is
said
to
have
been
created
some
thousands
of
years
before
adam
according
to
a
tradition
from
the
prophet
this
species
consists
of
five
orders
or
classes
namely
jÃnn
who
are
the
least
powerful
of
all
jinn
sheyáÃns
or
devils
efreets
and
mÃrids
the
last
it
is
added
are
the
most
powerful
and
the
jÃnn
are
transformed
jinn
like
as
certain
apes
and
swine
were
transformed
men52âit
must
however
be
remarked
here
that
the
terms
jinn
and
jÃnn
are
generally
used
indiscriminately
as
names
of
the
whole
species
including
the
other
orders
above
mentioned
whether
good
or
bad
and
that
the
former
term
is
the
more
common
also
that
sheyáÃn
is
commonly
used
to
signify
any
evil
jinnee
an
efreet
is
a
powerful
evil
jinnee53
a
mÃrid
an
evil
jinnee
of
the
most
powerful
class
the
jinn
but
generally
speaking
evil
ones
are
called
by
the
persians
deevs
the
most
powerful
evil
jinn
narahs
which
signifies
males
though
they
are
said
to
be
males
and
females
the
good
jinn
perees
though
this
term
is
commonly
applied
to
females

in
a
tradition
from
the
prophet
it
is
said
the
jÃnn
were
created
of
a
smokeless
fire54
the
word
which
signifies
a
smokeless
fire
has
been
misunderstood
by
some
as
meaning
the
flame
of
fire
el-jÃharee
in
the
áeáÃá
renders
it
rightly
and
says
that
of
this
fire
was
the
sheyáÃn
iblees
created
el-jÃnn
is
sometimes
used
as
a
name
for
iblees
as
in
the
following
verse
of
the
áur-Ãnâand
the
jÃnn
the
father
of
the
jinn
i
e
iblees
we
had
created
before
i
e
before
the
creation
of
adam
of
the
fire
of
the
samoom
i
e
of
fire
without
smoke55
jÃnn
also
signifies
a
serpent
as
in
other
passages
of
the
áur-Ãn56
and
is
used
in
the
same
book
as
synonymous
with
jinn57
in
the
last
sense
it
is
generally
believed
to
be
used
in
the
tradition
quoted
in
the
commencement
of
this
paragraph
there
are
several
28apparently
contradictory
traditions
from
the
prophet
which
are
reconciled
by
what
has
been
above
stated
in
one
it
is
said
that
iblees
was
the
father
of
all
the
jÃnn
and
sheyáÃns58
jÃnn
being
here
synonymous
with
jinn
in
another
that
jÃnn
was
the
father
of
all
the
jinn59
here
jÃnn
being
used
as
a
name
of
iblees

it
is
held
says
el-áazweenee
that
the
jinn
are
aerial
animals
with
transparent
bodies
which
can
assume
various
forms
people
differ
in
opinion
respecting
these
beings
some
consider
the
jinn
and
sheyáÃns
as
unruly
men
but
these
persons
are
of
the
moáºtezileh
a
sect
of
muslim
freethinkers
and
some
hold
that
god
whose
name
be
exalted
created
the
angels
of
the
light
of
fire
and
the
jinn
of
its
flame
but
this
is
at
variance
with
the
general
opinion
and
the
sheytÃns
of
its
smoke
which
is
also
at
variance
with
the
common
opinion
and
that
all
these
kinds
of
beings
are
usually
invisible60
to
men
but
that
they
assume
what
forms
they
please
and
when
their
form
becomes
condensed
they
are
visibleâthis
last
remark
illustrates
several
descriptions
of
jinnees
in
this
work
where
the
form
of
the
monster
is
at
first
undefined
or
like
an
enormous
pillar
and
then
gradually
assumes
a
human
shape
and
less
gigantic
size
the
particular
forms
of
brutes
reptiles
c
in
which
the
jinn
most
frequently
appear
will
be
mentioned
hereafter

it
is
said
that
god
created
the
jÃnn
or
jinn
two
thousand
years
before
adam
or
according
to
some
writers
much
earlier
and
that
there
are
believers
and
infidels
and
every
sect
among
them
as
among
men61âsome
say
that
a
prophet
named
yoosuf
was
sent
to
the
jinn
others
that
they
had
only
preachers
or
admonishers
others
again
that
seventy
apostles
were
sent
before
moáammad
to
jinn
and
men
conjointly62
it
is
commonly
believed
that
the
preadamite
jinn
were
governed
by
forty
or
according
to
some
seventy-two
kings
to
each
of
whom
the
arab
writers
give
the
name
of
suleymÃn
or
solomon
and
that
they
derive
their
appellation
from
the
last
of
these
who
was
called
jÃnn
ibn-jÃnn
and
who
some
say
built
the
pyramids
of
egypt
the
following
account
of
the
preadamite
jinn
is
given
by
el-áazweeneeâit
is
related
in
histories
that
a
race
of
jinn
in
ancient
times
before
the
creation
of
adam
inhabited
the
earth
and
covered
it
the
land
and
the
sea
and
the
plains
and
the
mountains
and
the
favours
of
god
were
multiplied
upon
them
and
they
had
government
and
prophecy
and
religion
and
law
but
they
transgressed
and
offended
and
opposed
their
prophets
and
made
wickedness
to
abound
in
the
earth
whereupon
god
whose
name
be
exalted
sent
against
them
an
army
of
angels
who
took
possession
of
the
earth
and
drove
away
the
jinn
to
the
regions
of
the
islands
and
made
many
of
them
prisoners
and
of
those
who
were
made
prisoners
was
azÃzeel
afterwards
called
iblees
from
his
despair
and
a
slaughter
was
made
among
them
at
that
time
azÃzeel
was
young
he
grew
up
among
the
angels
and
probably
for
that
reason
was
called
one
of
them
and
became
learned
in
their
knowledge
and
assumed
the
government
of
them
and
his
days
were
prolonged
until
he
became
their
chief
and
thus
it
continued
for
a
long
time
until
the
affair
between
him
and
adam
happened
as
god
whose
name
be
exalted
hath
said
when
we
said
unto
the
angels
worship63
ye
adam
and
all
worshipped
except
iblees
who
was
one
of
the
jinn64

iblees
we
are
told
by
another
authority
was
sent
as
a
governor
upon
the
earth
and
judged
among
the
jinn
a
thousand
years
after
which
he
ascended
into
heaven
and
remained
employed
in
worship
until
the
creation
of
adam65
the
name
of
iblees
was
originally
according
to
some
azÃzeel
as
before
mentioned
and
according
to
others
el-áÃrith
his
patronymic
is
aboo-murrah
or
abu-l-ghimr66âit
is
disputed
whether
29he
was
of
the
angels
or
of
the
jinn
there
are
three
opinions
on
this
pointâ1
that
he
was
of
the
angels
from
a
tradition
from
ibn-abbÃsâ2
that
he
was
of
the
sheyáÃns
or
evil
jinn
as
it
is
said
in
the
áur-Ãn
except
iblees
who
was
one
of
the
jinn
this
was
the
opinion
of
el-áasan
el-baáree
and
is
that
commonly
heldâ3
that
he
was
neither
of
the
angels
nor
of
the
jinn
but
created
alone
of
fireâibn-abbÃs
founds
his
opinion
on
the
same
text
from
which
el-áasan
el-baáree
derives
his
when
we
said
unto
the
angels
worship
ye
adam
and
all
worshipped
except
iblees
who
was
one
of
the
jinn
before
quoted
which
he
explains
by
saying
that
the
most
noble
and
honourable
among
the
angels
are
called
the
jinn
because
they
are
veiled
from
the
eyes
of
the
other
angels
on
account
of
their
superiority
and
that
iblees
was
one
of
these
jinn
he
adds
that
he
had
the
government
of
the
lowest
heaven
and
of
the
earth
and
was
called
the
áÃoos
literally
peacock
of
the
angels
and
that
there
was
not
a
spot
in
the
lowest
heaven
but
he
had
prostrated
himself
upon
it
but
when
the
jinn
rebelled
upon
the
earth
god
sent
a
troop
of
angels
who
drove
them
to
the
islands
and
mountains
and
iblees
being
elated
with
pride
and
refusing
to
prostrate
himself
before
adam
god
transformed
him
into
a
sheyáÃnâbut
this
reasoning
is
opposed
by
other
verses
in
which
iblees
is
represented
as
saying
thou
hast
created
me
of
fire
and
hast
created
him
adam
of
earth67
it
is
therefore
argued
if
he
were
created
originally
of
fire
how
was
he
created
of
light
for
the
angels
were
all
created
of
light68âthe
former
verse
may
be
explained
by
the
tradition
that
iblees
having
been
taken
captive
was
exalted
among
the
angels
or
perhaps
there
is
an
ellipsis
after
the
word
angels
for
it
might
be
inferred
that
the
command
given
to
the
angels
was
also
and
Ã

fortiori
to
be
obeyed
by
the
jinn

according
to
a
tradition
iblees
and
all
the
sheyáÃns
are
distinguished
from
the
other
jinn
by
a
longer
existence
the
sheyáÃns
it
is
added
are
the
children
of
iblees
and
die
not
but
with
him
whereas
the
other
jinn
die
before
him69
though
they
may
live
many
centuries
but
this
is
not
altogether
accordant
with
the
popular
belief
iblees
and
many
other
evil
jinn
are
to
survive
mankind
but
they
are
to
die
before
the
general
resurrection
as
also
even
the
angels
the
last
of
whom
will
be
the
angel
of
death
azraeel
yet
not
all
the
evil
jinn
are
to
live
thus
long
many
of
them
are
killed
by
shooting
stars
hurled
at
them
from
heaven
wherefore
the
arabs
when
they
see
a
shooting
star
shihÃb
often
exclaim
may
god
transfix
the
enemy
of
the
faithâmany
also
are
killed
by
other
jinn
and
some
even
by
men
the
fire
of
which
the
jinnee
is
created
circulates
in
his
veins
in
place
of
blood
therefore
when
he
receives
a
mortal
wound
this
fire
issuing
from
his
veins
generally
consumes
him
to
ashesâthe
jinn
it
has
been
already
shown
are
peccable
they
also
eat
and
drink
and
propagate
their
species
sometimes
in
conjunction
with
human
beings
in
which
latter
case
the
offspring
partakes
of
the
nature
of
both
parents
in
all
these
respects
they
differ
from
the
angels
among
the
evil
jinn
are
distinguished
the
five
sons
of
their
chief
iblees
namely
teer
who
brings
about
calamities
losses
and
injuries
el-aáºwar
who
encourages
debauchery
sÃá
who
suggests
lies
dÃsim
who
causes
hatred
between
man
and
wife
and
zelemboor
who
presides
over
places
of
traffic70

the
most
common
forms
and
habitations
or
places
of
resort
of
the
jinn
must
now
be
described

the
following
traditions
from
the
prophet
are
the
most
to
the
purpose
that
i
have
seenâthe
jinn
are
of
various
shapes
having
the
forms
of
serpents
scorpions
lions
wolves
jackals
c71âthe
jinn
are
of
three
kinds
one
on
the
land
one
in
the
sea
and
one
in
the
air72
the
jinn
consist
of
forty
troops
each
troop
consisting
of
six
hundred
thousand73âthe
jinn
are
of
three
kinds
one
have
wings
and
fly
another
30are
snakes
and
dogs
and
the
third
move
about
from
place
to
place
like
men74âdomestic
snakes
are
asserted
to
be
jinn
on
the
same
authority75

the
prophet
ordered
his
followers
to
kill
serpents
and
scorpions
if
they
intruded
at
prayers
but
on
other
occasions
he
seems
to
have
required
first
to
admonish
them
to
depart
and
then
if
they
remained
to
kill
them
the
doctors
however
differ
in
opinion
whether
all
kinds
of
snakes
or
serpents
should
be
admonished
first
or
whether
any
should
for
the
prophet
say
they
took
a
covenant
of
the
jinn
probably
after
the
above-mentioned
command
that
they
should
not
enter
the
houses
of
the
faithful
therefore
it
is
argued
if
they
enter
they
break
their
covenant
and
it
becomes
lawful
to
kill
them
without
previous
admonishment
yet
it
is
related
that
Ãisheh
the
prophets
wife
having
killed
a
serpent
in
her
chamber
was
alarmed
by
a
dream
and
fearing
that
it
might
have
been
a
muslim
jinnee
as
it
did
not
enter
her
chamber
when
she
was
undressed
gave
in
alms
as
an
expiation
twelve
thousand
dirhems
about
Â300
the
price
of
the
blood
of
a
muslim76

the
jinn
are
said
to
appear
to
mankind
most
commonly
in
the
shapes
of
serpents
dogs
cats
or
human
beings
in
the
last
case
they
are
sometimes
of
the
stature
of
men
and
sometimes
of
a
size
enormously
gigantic
if
good
they
are
generally
resplendently
handsome
if
evil
horribly
hideous
they
become
invisible
at
pleasure
by
a
rapid
extension
or
rarefaction
of
the
particles
which
compose
them
or
suddenly
disappear
in
the
earth
or
air
or
through
a
solid
wall
many
muslims
in
the
present
day
profess
to
have
seen
and
held
intercourse
with
them

the
zÃbaah
which
is
a
whirlwind
that
raises
the
sand
or
dust
in
the
form
of
a
pillar
of
prodigious
height
often
seen
sweeping
across
the
deserts
and
fields
is
believed
to
be
caused
by
the
flight
of
an
evil
jinnee
to
defend
themselves
from
a
jinnee
thus
riding
in
the
whirlwind
the
arabs
often
exclaim
iron
iron
áadeed
áadeed
or
iron
thou
unlucky
áadeed
yÃ
mashoom
as
the
jinn
are
supposed
to
have
a
great
dread
of
that
metal
or
they
exclaim
god
is
most
great
allÃhu
akbar77
a
similar
superstition
prevails

from

a

in

occasions
this
note
to
be
here
inserted

it
is
believed
that
the
chief
abode
of
the
jinn
is
in
the
mountains
of
áÃf
which
are
supposed
as
mentioned
on
a
former
occasion
to
encompass
the
whole
of
our
earth
but
they
are
also
believed
to
pervade
the
solid
body
of
our
earth
and
the
firmament
and
to
choose
as
their
principal
places
of
resort
or
of

the

there
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
angels
respecting
things
decreed
by

obtain
knowledge
of
futurity
which
they
sometimes
impart
to
men
who
by
means
of
talismans
or
certain
invocations
make
them
to
serve
the
purposes
of
magical
performances
to
this
particular
subject
it
will
be
necessary
to
revertâwhat
the
prophet
said
of
iblees
in
the
following
tradition
applies
also
to
the
evil
jinn
over
whom
he
presidesâhis
chief
abode
among
men
is
the
bath
his
chief
places
of
resort
are
the
markets
and
the
junctures
of

food
is

that
particular
jinnees
presided
over
particular
places
was
an
opinion
of
the
early
arabs
it
is
said
in
the
áur-Ãn
and
there
were
certain
men
who
sought
refuge
with
certain
of
the
jinn82
in
the
commentary
of
the
jelÃleyn
i
find
the
following
remark
on
these
wordsâwhen
they
halted
on
their
journey
in
a
place
of
fear
each
man
said
i
seek
refuge
with
the
lord
of
this
place
from
the
mischief
of
his
foolish
ones
in
illustration
of
this
i
may
insert
the
following
tradition
translated
from
el-áazweeneeâit
is
related
by
a
certain
narrator
of
traditions
that
he
descended
into
a
valley
with
his
sheep
and
a
wolf
carried
off
a
ewe
from
among
them
and
he
arose
and
raised
his
voice
and
cried
o
inhabitant
of
the
valley
whereupon
he
heard
a
voice
saying
o
wolf
restore
to
him
his
sheep
and
the
wolf
came
with
the
ewe
and
left
her
and
departedâthe
same
opinion
is
held
by
the
modern
arabs
though
probably
they
do
not
use
such
an
invocationâa
similar
superstition
a
relic
of
ancient
egyptian
credulity
still
prevails
among
the
people
of
cairo
it
is
believed
that
each
quarter
of
this
city
has
its
peculiar
guardian-genius
or
agathodÃmon
which
has
the
form
of
a
serpent83

it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
some
of
the
jinn
are
muslims
and
others
infidels
the
good
jinn
acquit
themselves
of
the
imperative
duties
of
religion
namely
prayers
alms-giving
fasting
during
the
month
of
ramaáÃn
and
pilgrimage
to
mekkeh
and
mount
arafÃt
but
in
the
performance
of
these
duties
they
are
generally
invisible
to
human
beings
some
examples
of
the
mode
in
which
good
jinn
pay
the
alms
required
of
them
by
the
law
i
have
given
in
a
former
work84

of
the
services
and
injuries
done
by
jinn
to
men
some
account
must
be
given

it
has
been
stated
that
by
means
of
talismans
or
certain
invocations
men
are
said
to
obtain
the
services
of
jinn
and
the
manner
in
which
the
latter
are
enabled
to
assist
magicians
by
imparting
to
them
the
knowledge
of
future
events
has
been
explained
no
man
ever
obtained
such
absolute
power
over
the
jinn
as
suleymÃn
ibn-dÃood
solomon
the
son
of
david
this
he
did
by
virtue
of
a
most
wonderful
talisman
which
is
said
to
have
come
down
to
him
from
heaven
it
was
a
seal-ring
upon
which
was
engraved
the
most
great
name
of
god
and
was
partly
composed
of
brass
and
partly
of
iron
with
the
brass
he
stamped
his
written
commands
to
the
good
jinn
with
the
iron
for
a
reason
before
mentioned
those
to
the
evil
jinn
or
devils
over
both
orders
he
had
unlimited
power
as
well
as
over
the
birds
and
the
winds85
and
as
is
generally
said
the
wild
beasts
his
wezeer
aáaf
the
son
of
barkhiyÃ

is
also
said
to
have
been
acquainted
with
the
most
great
name
by
uttering
which
the
greatest
miracles
may
be
performed
even
that
of
raising
the
dead
by
virtue
of
this
name
engraved
on
his
ring
suleymÃn
compelled
the
jinn
to
assist
in
building
the
temple
of
jerusalem
and
in
various
other
works
many
of
the
evil
jinn
he
converted
to
the
true
faith
and
many
others
of
this
class
who
remained
obstinate
in
infidelity
he
confined
in
prisons
he
is
said
to
have
been
monarch
of
the
whole
earth
hence
perhaps
the
name
of
suleymÃn
is
given
to
the
universal
monarchs
of
the
preadamite
jinn
unless
the
story
of
his
own
universal
dominion
originated
from
confounding
him
with
those
kings
of
the
jinn

the
injuries
related
to
have
been
inflicted
upon
human
beings
by
evil
jinn
are
of
various
kinds
jinnees
are
said
to
have
often
carried
off
beautiful
women
whom
they
have
forcibly
kept
as
their
wives
or
concubines
i
have
mentioned
in
a
former
work
that
malicious
or
disturbed
jinnees
are
asserted
often
to
station
themselves
on
the
roofs
32or
at
the
windows
of
houses
and
to
throw
down
bricks
and
stones
on
persons
passing
by86
when
they
take
possession
of
an
uninhabited
house
they
seldom
fail
to
persecute
terribly
any
person
who
goes
to
reside
in
it
they
are
also
very
apt
to
pilfer
provisions
c
many
learned
and
devout
persons
to
secure
their
property
from
such
depredations
repeat
the
words
in
the
name
of
god
the
compassionate
the
merciful
on
locking
the
doors
of
their
houses
rooms
or
closets
and
on
covering
the
bread-basket
or
anything
containing
food87
during
the
month
of
ramaáÃn
the
evil
jinn
are
believed
to
be
confined
in
prison
and
therefore
on
the
last
night
of
that
month
with
the
same
view
women
sometimes
repeat
the
words
above
mentioned
and
sprinkle
salt
upon
the
floors
of
the
apartments
of
their
houses88

to
complete
this
sketch
of
arabian
mythology
an
account
must
be
added
of
several
creatures
generally
believed
to
be
of
inferior
orders
of
the
jinn

one
of
these
is
the
ghool
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
a
kind
of
sheytÃn
or
evil
jinnee
that
eats
men
and
is
also
described
by
some
as
a
jinnee
or
an
enchanter
who
assumes
various
forms
the
ghools
are
said
to
appear
in
the
forms
of
various
animals
and
of
human
beings
and
in
many
monstrous
shapes
to
haunt
burial-grounds
and
other
sequestered
spots
to
feed
upon
dead
human
bodies
and
to
kill
and
devour
any
human
creature
who
has
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
their
way
whence
the
term
ghool
is
applied
to
any
cannibal
an
opinion
quoted
by
a
celebrated
author
respecting
the
ghool
is
that
it
is
a
demoniacal
animal
which
passes
a
solitary
existence
in
the
deserts
resembling
both
man
and
brute
that
it
appears
to
a
person
travelling
alone
in
the
night
and
in
solitary
places
and
being
supposed
by
him
to
be
itself
a
traveller
lures
him
out
of
his
way89
another
opinion
stated
by
him
is
this
that
when
the
sheytÃns
attempt
to
hear
words
by
stealth
from
the
confines
of
the
lowest
heaven
they
are
struck
by
shooting
stars
and
some
are
burnt
some
falling
into
a
sea
or
rather
a
large
river
baár
become
converted
into
crocodiles
and
some
falling
upon
the
land
become
ghools
the
same
author
adds
the
following
traditionâthe
ghool
is
any
jinnee
that
is
opposed
to
travels
assuming
various
forms
and
appearances90
and
affirms
that
several
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
saw
ghools
in
their
travels
and
that
omar
among
them
saw
a
ghool
while
on
a
journey
to
syria
before
el-islÃm
and
struck
it
with
his
swordâit
appears
that
ghool
is
properly
speaking
a
name
only
given
to
a
female
demon
of
the
kind
above
described
the
male
is
called
áuárub91
it
is
said
that
these
beings
and
the
ghaddÃr
or
gharrÃr
and
other
similar
creatures
which
will
presently
be
mentioned
are
the
offspring
of
iblees
and
of
a
wife
whom
god
created
for
him
of
the
fire
of
the
samoom
which
here
signifies
as
in
an
instance
before
mentioned
a
smokeless
fire
and
that
they
sprang
from
an
egg92
the
female
ghool
it
is
added
appears
to
men
in
the
deserts
in
various
forms
converses
with
them
and
sometimes
prostitutes
herself
to
them93

the
seáºlÃh
or
saáºlÃh
is
another
demoniacal
creature
described
by
some
or
rather
by
most
authors
as
of
the
jinn
it
is
said
that
it
is
mostly
found
in
forests
and
that
when
it
captures
a
man
it
makes
him
dance
and
plays
with
him
as
the
cat
plays
with
the
mouse
a
man
of
iáfahÃn
asserted
that
many
beings
of
this
kind
abounded
in
his
country
that
sometimes
the
wolf
would
hunt
one
of
them
by
night
and
devour
it
and
that
when
it
had
seized
it
the
seáºlÃh
would
cry
out
come
to
my
help
for
the
wolf
devoureth
me
or
it
would
cry
who
will
liberate
me
i
have
a
hundred
deenÃrs
and
he
shall
receive
them
but
the
people
knowing
that
it
was
the
cry
of
the
seáºlÃh
no
one
would
liberate
it
and
so
the
wolf
would
eat
it94âan
island
in
the
sea
of
eá-áeen
or
china
is
called
the
island
of
the
seáºlÃh
by
arab
geographers
from
its
being
said
to
be
inhabited
by
the
demons
so
named
they
are
described
as
33creatures
of
hideous
forms
supposed
to
be
sheyáÃns
the
offspring
of
human
beings
and
jinn
who
eat
men95

the
ghaddÃr
or
gharrÃr
for
its
name
is
written
differently
in
two
different
mss
in
my
possession
is
another
creature
of
a
similar
nature
described
as
being
found
in
the
borders
of
el-yemen
and
sometimes
in
tihÃmeh
and
in
the
upper
parts
of
egypt
it
is
said
that
it
entices
a
man
to
it
and
either
tortures
him
in
a
manner
not
to
be
described
or
merely
terrifies
him
and
leaves
him96

the
delhÃn
is
also
a
demoniacal
being
inhabiting
the
islands
of
the
seas
having
the
form
of
a
man
and
riding
on
an
ostrich
it
eats
the
flesh
of
men
whom
the
sea
casts
on
the
shore
from
wrecks
some
say
that
a
delhÃn
once
attacked
a
ship
in
the
sea
and
desired
to
take
the
crew
but
they
contended
with
it
whereupon
it
uttered
a
cry
which
caused
them
to
fall
upon
their
faces
and
it
took
them97âin
my
ms
of
ibn-el-wardee
i
find
the
name
written
dahlÃn
he
mentions
an
island
called
by
this
name
in
the
sea
of
omÃn
and
describes
its
inhabitants
as
cannibal
sheyáÃns
like
men
in
form
and
riding
on
birds
resembling
ostriches

the
shiáá
is
another
demoniacal
creature
having
the
form
of
half
a
human
being
like
a
man
divided
longitudinally
and
it
is
believed
that
the
nesnÃs
is
the
offspring
of
a
shiáá

of
a
human
being

shiáá

to
travellers

a
demon
of
this
kind

killed

was
killed
by
aláamah

son
of

half
a
head
half
a
body
one
arm

with
which
it
hops
with

the

the
wickedness
of
women
is
a
subject
upon
which
the
stronger
sex
among
the
arabs
with
an
affected
feeling
of
superior
virtue
often
dwell
in
common
conversation
that
women
are
deficient

judgment

is
held
as
a
fact
not

by
themselves

it
rests
on
an
assertion

that
they

equally
certain

consult

do
the
contrary
of
what
they
advise

this
is
not
to
be
done
merely
for
the
sake
of
opposing
them
nor
when
other
advice
can
be
had
it
is
desirable
for
a
man
says
a
learned
imÃm
before
he
enters
upon
any
important
undertaking
to
consult
ten
intelligent
persons
among
his
particular
friends
or
if
he
have
not
more
than
five
such
friends
let
him
consult
each
of
them
twice
or
if
he
have
not
more
than
one
friend
he
should
consult
him
ten
times
at
ten
different
visits
if
he
have
not
one
to
consult
let
him
return
to
his
wife
and
consult
her
and
whatever
she
advises
him
to
do
let
him
do
the
contrary
so
shall
he
proceed
rightly
in
his
affair
and
attain
his
object104
a
truly
virtuous
wife
is
of
course
excepted
in
this
rule
such
a
person
is
as
much
respected
by
muslims
as
she
is
at

according
to
their
own
account
rarely
met
with
by
them
when
woman
was
created
the
devil

are

i
remember
being
roused
from
the
quiet
that
i
generally
enjoyed
in
an
ancient
tomb
in
which
i
resided
at
thebes
by
the
cries
of
a
young
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
an
arab
was
severely
beating
for
an
impudent
proposal
that
she
had
made
to

cruelty
ascribed
to
shahriyÃr

wish
that
i
could
accuse
the
author
of
inventing
in
this
case
an
incident
of
an
incredible
nature
and
entirely
unparalleled
but
alas
acts
of
equal
cruelty
are
recorded
of
arab
princes

35in

i
have
not
read
of
any
case
exactly
resembling
that
to
which
this
note
relates
but
the
following
anecdote
will
shew
that
if
conduct
still
more
atrocious
had
been
described
in
the
latter
it
might
have
been
founded
on
fact
in
the
year
of
the
flight
423
the
khaleefeh
of
egypt
eáº-áºÃhir
the
son
of
el-áÃkim
collected
together
all
the
female
slaves
that
were
in
the
palace
and
said
to
them
assemble
together
and
i
will
make
a
day
of
pleasure
for
you
such
as
hath
not
before
been
seen
in
egypt
he
ordered
also
that
every
person
who
had
a
female
slave
should
bring
her
and
that
none
of
them
should
come
but
with
her
ornaments
of
jewels
and
gold
they
did
so
and
there
was
not
a
single
one
that
did
not
come
he
then
placed
them
in
a
chamber
and
calling
some
masons
made
them
build
up
the
door
of
the
chamber
upon
them
and
so
they
all
died
this
happened
on
friday
the
mohammadan
sabbath
the
6th
of
showwÃl
the
number
of
them
was
two
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
female
slaves
after
they
had
remained
six
months
he
heaped
lighted
combustibles
upon
them
and
burned
them
together
with
their
clothes
and
ornaments

i
here
deviate
a
little
from
my
original
in
which
shahrazÃd
is
made
to
say
either
i
shall
live
or
i
shall
be
a
ransom
for
the
daughters
of
the
muslims
and
the
cause
of
their
deliverance
from
him
upon
this
the
sheykh
moáammed
eiyÃd
has
remarked
in
a
marginal
note
it
would
seem
that
she
had
contrived
some
stratagem
to
prevent
his
marrying
again
if
he
determined
to
kill
her
otherwise
the
mere
killing
her
would
not
be
a
means
of
rescuing
the
other
maidens

the
language
of

c
it
is
commonly
believed
by
the
muslims
learned
and
unlearned
that
all
kinds
of
birds
and
many
if
not
all
beasts
have
a
language
by
which
they
communicate
their
thoughts
to
each
other
and
we
are
told
in
the
áur-Ãn107
that
suleymÃn
or
solomon
was
taught
the
language
of
birds108
i
thought
that
i
could
boast
of
an
accomplishment
very
rare
in
christian
countries
in
having
learned
in
egypt
somewhat
of
this
language

that

the
phrase
with
which
the
bull
commences
his
address
to
the

is
one
dictated
by
an
indispensable
rule
of
muslim
politeness
which
requires
that
these
or
some
similar
words
should
be
uttered
by
a
person
whenever
he
sees
another
with
food
before
him
and
does
not
partake
of
it
if
this
were
not
done
it
would
be
feared
that
the
food
had
been
poisoned
or
rendered
of
no

by
an
envious
eye

prayers
at

soon
after
daybreak
and
he
generally
awakes
before
this

while
shahriyÃr
therefore
was
waiting
for
the
dawn
of
day
to
acquit
himself
of
this
duty
in
accordance
with
the
common
custom
of
mohammadan
kings
shahrazÃd
amused
him
by
the
recitation
of
her
tales
that
he
should
be
described
as
thus
strict
with
regard
to
religious
exercises
when
about
to
give
orders
for
the
murder
of
his
innocent
wife
needs
not
excite
our
surprise
such
conduct
is
consistent
with
the
character
of
many
muslims
in
the
year
1834
when
i
was
residing
in
cairo
a
general
in
the
service
of
moáammad
alee
hired
a
large
party
of
men
to
perform
a
recital
of
the
áur-Ãn
in
his
house
in
that
city
and
then
went
up
into
his
áareem
and
strangled
his
wife
in
consequence
of
a
report
which
accused
her
of
incontinence
the
religious
ceremony
was
designed
as
preparatory
to
this
act
though
the
punishment
of
the
woman
was
contrary
to
the
law
since
her
husband
neither
produced
four
witnesses
of
the
imputed
crime
nor
allowed
her
to
clear
herself
of
the
charge
by
her
own
oath
another
case
of
diligence
in
the
performance
of
a
religious
duty
accompanied
by
the
contemplation
of
murder
but
murder
on
a
larger
scale
occurred
in
the

shortly
after

do
this
it
37was
necessary
that
he
should
purchase
two
houses
adjoining
the
plot
in
which
the
foundations
had
been
laid
but
the
owners
of
these
houses
refused
to
sell
them
and
he
therefore
employed
a
number
of
workmen
to
undermine
them
by
night
and
cause
them
to
fall
upon
their
inhabitants
his
scheme
however
but
partially
succeeded
and
no
lives
were
sacrificed
this
man
was
notorious

cruelty

he
was
a
person

o

shahrazÃd
that
there
was
a
certain
merchant
who
had
great
wealth
and
traded
extensively
with
surrounding
countries
and
one
day
he
mounted
his
horse
and
journeyed
to
a
neighbouring
country
to
collect
what
was
due
to
him
and
the
heat
oppressing
him
he
sat
under
a
tree
in
a
garden1
and
put
his
hand
into
his
saddle-bag2
and
ate
a
morsel
of
bread
and
a
date
which
were
among
his
provisions
having
eaten
the
date
he
threw
aside
the
stone3
and
immediately
there
appeared
before
him
an
efreet
of
enormous
height
who
holding
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
approached
him
and
said
rise
that
i
may
kill
thee
as
thou
hast
killed
my
son
the
merchant
asked
him
how
have
i
killed
thy
son
he
answered
when
thou
atest
the
date
and
threwest
aside
the
stone
it
struck
my
son
upon
the
chest4
and
as
fate

on
hearing
these
words6
exclaimed

we
belong
and
verily
to
him
we
must
return

is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in

high
the
great
if
i
killed
him
i
did
it
not
intentionally
but
without
knowing
it
and
i
trust
in
thee
that
thou
wilt
pardon
meâthe
jinnee
answered
thy
death
is
indispensable
as
thou
hast
killed
my
sonâand
so
saying
he
dragged
him
and
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
raised
his
arm
to
strike
him
with
the
sword
the
merchant
upon
this
wept
bitterly
and
said
to
the
jinnee
i
commit
my
affair
unto
god
for
no
one
can
avoid40
what
he
hath
decreedâand
he
continued
his
lamentation
repeating
the
following
versesâ

thoughtest
well
of
the
days
when
they
went
well
with
thee
and
fearedst
not
the
evil
that
destiny
was
bringing
âwhen
he
had
finished
reciting
these
verses
the
jinnee
said
to
him
spare
thy
words
for
thy
death
is
unavoidable

then
said
the
merchant
know
o
efreet
that
i
have
debts
to
pay
and
i
have
much
property
and
children
and
a
wife
and
i
have
pledges
also
in
my
possession
let
me
therefore
go
back
to
my
house
and
give
to
every
one
his
due
and
then
i
will
return
to
thee
i
bind
myself
by
a
vow
and
covenant
that
i
will
return
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
do
what
thou
wilt
and
god
is
witness
of
what
i
sayâupon
this
the
jinnee
accepted
his
covenant
and
liberated
him
granting
him
a
respite
until
the
expiration
of
the
year

the
merchant
therefore
returned
to
his
town
accomplished
all
that
was
upon
his
mind
to
do
paid
every
one
what
he
owed
him
and
informed
his
wife
and
children
of
the
event
which
had
befallen
him
upon
hearing
which
they
and
all
his
family
and
women
wept
he
appointed
a
guardian
over
his
children
and
remained
with
his
family
until
the
end
of
the
year
when
he
took
his
grave-clothes
under
his
arm7
bade
farewell
to
his
household
and
neighbours
and
all
his
relations
and
went
forth
in
spite
of
himself
his
family
raising
cries
of
lamentation
and
shrieking8

he
proceeded
until
he
arrived
at
the
garden
before
mentioned
and
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
and
as
he
sat
weeping
for
the
calamity
which
he
expected
soon
to
befall
him
a
sheykh9
advanced
in
years
approached
him
leading
a
gazelle
with
a
chain
attached
to
its
neck
this
sheykh
saluted
the
merchant
wishing
him
a
long
life
and
said
to
him
what
is
the
reason
of
thy
sitting
alone
in
this
place
seeing
that
it
is
a
resort
of
the
jinn
the
merchant
therefore41
informed
him
of
what
had
befallen
him
with
the
efreet
and
of
the
cause
of
his
sitting
there
at
which
the
sheykh
the
owner
of
the
gazelle
was
astonished
and
said
by
allah
o
my
brother
thy
faithfulness
is
great
and
thy
story
is
wonderful
if
it
were
engraved
upon
the
intellect
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
who
would
be
admonishedâand
he
sat
down
by
his
side
and
said
by
allah
o
my
brother
i
will
not
quit
this
place
until
i
see
what
will
happen
unto
thee
with
this
efreet
so
he
sat
down
and
conversed
with
him
and
the
merchant
became
almost
senseless
fear
entered
him
and
terror
and
violent
grief
and
excessive
anxiety
and
as
the
owner
of
the
gazelle
sat
by
his
side
lo
a
second
sheykh
approached
them
with
two
black
hounds
and
inquired
of
them
after
saluting
them
the
reason
of
their
sitting
in
that
place
seeing
that
it
was
a
resort
of
the
jÃnn10
and
they
told
him
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
and
he
had
hardly
sat
down
when
there
approached
them
a
third
sheykh
with
a
dapple
mule
and
he
asked
them
the
same
question
which
was
answered
in
the
same
manner

meeting
of
the
merchant
and
the
sheykh
with
the
gazelle
immediately
after
the
dust
was
agitated
and
became
an
enormous
revolving
pillar
approaching
them
from
the
midst
of
the
desert
and
this
dust
subsided
and
behold
the
jinnee
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
his
eyes
casting
forth
sparks
of
fire
he
came
to
them
and
dragged
from
them
the
merchant
and
said
to
him
rise
that
i
may
kill
thee
as
thou
killedst
my
son
the
vital
spirit
of
my
heart
and
the
merchant
wailed
and
wept
and
the
three
sheykhs
also
manifested
their
sorrow
by
weeping
and
crying
aloud
and
wailing
but
the
first
sheykh
who
was
the
owner
of
the
gazelle
recovering
his
self-possession
kissed
the
hand
of
the
efreet
and
said
to
him
o
thou
jinnee
and
crown
of
the
kings
of
the
jÃnn
if
i
relate
to
thee
the
story
of
myself
and
this
gazelle
and
thou
find
it
to
be
wonderful
and
more
so
than
the
adventure
of
this
merchant
wilt
thou
give
up
to
me
a
third42
of
thy
claim
to
his
blood
he
answered
yes
o
sheykh
if
thou
relate
to
me
the
story
and
i
find
it
to
be
as
thou
hast
said
i
will
give
up
to
thee
a
third
of
my
claim
to
his
blood

return
of
the
jinnee
the
story
of
the
first
sheykh
and
the
gazelle

then
said
the
sheykh
know
o
efreet
that
this
gazelle
is
the
daughter
of
my
paternal
uncle11
and
she
is
of
my
flesh
and
my
blood
i
took
her
as
my
wife
when
she
was
young12
and
lived
with
her
about
thirty
years
but
i
was
not
blessed
with
a
child
by
her
so
i
took
to
me
a
concubine
slave13
and
by
her
i
was
blessed
with
a
male
child
like
the
rising
full
moon
with
beautiful
eyes
and
delicately-shaped
eyebrows
and
perfectly-formed
limbs
and
he
grew
up
by
little
and
little
until
he
attained
the
age
of
fifteen
years
at
this
period
i
unexpectedly
had
occasion
to
journey
to
a
certain
city
and
went
thither
with
a
great
stock
of
merchandise

now
my
cousin14
this
gazelle
had
studied
enchantment
and
divination
from
her
early
years
and
during
my
absence
she
transformed
the
youth
above
mentioned
into
a
calf
and
his
mother
into43
a
cow15
and
committed
them
to
the
care
of
the
herdsman
and
when
i
returned
after
a
long
time
from
my
journey
i
asked
after
my
son
and
his
mother
and
she
said
thy
slave
is
dead
and
thy
son
hath
fled
and
i
know
not
whither
he
is
gone
after
hearing
this
i
remained
for
the
space
of
a
year
with
mourning
heart
and
weeping
eye
until
the
festival
of
the
sacrifice16
when
i
sent
to
the
herdsman
and
ordered
him
to
choose
for
me
a
fat
cow
and
he
brought
me
one
and
it
was
my
concubine
whom
this
gazelle
had
enchanted
i
tucked
up
my
skirts
and
sleeves
and
took
the
knife17
in
my
hand
and
prepared
myself
to
slaughter
her
upon
which
she
moaned
and
cried
so
violently
that
i
left
her
and
ordered
the
herdsman
to
kill
and
skin
her
and
he
did
so
but
found
in
her
neither
fat
nor
flesh
nor
anything
but
skin
and
bone
and
i
repented
of
slaughtering
her
when
repentance
was
of
no
avail
i
therefore
gave
her
to
the
herdsman
and
said
to
him
bring
me
a
fat
calf
and
he
brought
me
my
son
who
was
transformed
into
a
calf
and
when
the
calf
saw
me
he
broke
his
rope
and
came
to
me
and
fawned
upon
me
and
wailed
and
cried
so
that
i
was
moved
with
pity
for
him
and
i
said
to
the
herdsman
bring
me
a
cow
and
let
thisâ

transformation
of
the
concubine
into
a
cow
here
shahrazÃd
perceived
the
light
of
morning
and
discontinued
the
recitation
with
which
she
had
been
allowed
thus
far
to
proceed
her
sister
said
to
her
how
excellent
is
thy
story
and
how
pretty
and
how
pleasant
and
how
sweetâbut
she
answered
what
is
this
in
comparison
with
that
which
i
will
relate
to
thee
in
the
next
night
if
i
live
and
the
king
spare
me
and
the
king
said
by
allah
i
will
not
kill
her
until
i
hear
the
remainder
of
her
story
thus
they
pleasantly
passed
the
night
until
the
morning
when
the
king
went
forth
to
his
hall
of
judgment
and
the
wezeer
went
thither
with
the
grave-clothes
under
his
arm
and
the
king44
gave
judgment
and
invested
and
displaced
until
the
close
of
the
day
without
informing
the
wezeer
of
that
which
had
happened
and
the
minister
was
greatly
astonished
the
court
was
then
dissolved
and
the
king
returned
to
the
privacy
of
his
palace

on
the
second
and
each
succeeding
night
shahrazÃd
continued
so
to
interest
king
shahriyÃr
by
her
stories
as
to
induce
him
to
defer
putting
her
to
death
in
expectation
that
her
fund
of
amusing
tales
would
soon
be
exhausted
and
as
this
is
expressed
in
the
original
work
in
nearly
the
same
words
at
the
close
of
every
night
such
repetitions
will
in
the
present
translation
be
omitted18

when
the
sheykh
continued
shahrazÃd
observed
the
tears
of
the
calf
his
heart
sympathized
with
him
and
he
said
to
the
herdsman
let
this
calf
remain
with
the
cattleâmeanwhile
the
jinnee
wondered
at
this
strange
story
and
the
owner
of
the
gazelle
thus
proceeded

o
lord
of
the
kings
of
the
jÃnn
while
this
happened
my
cousin
this
gazelle
looked
on
and
said
slaughter
this
calf
for
he
is
fat
but
i
could
not
do
it
so
i
ordered
the
herdsman
to
take
him
back
and
he
took
him
and
went
away
and
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
following
day
he
came
to
me
and
said
o
my
master
i
have
to
tell
thee
something
that
thou
wilt
be
rejoiced
to
hear
and
a
reward
is
due
to
me
for
bringing
good
news19
i
answered
wellâand
he
said
o
merchant
i
have
a
daughter
who
learned
enchantment
in
her
youth
from
an
old
woman
in
our
family
and
yesterday
when
thou
gavest
me
the
calf
i
took
him
to
her
and
she
looked
at
him
and
covered
her
face
and
wept
and
then
laughed
and
said
o
my
father
hath
my
condition
become
so
degraded
in
thy
opinion
that
thou
bringest
before
me
strange
men20âwhere
said
i
are
any
strange
men
and
wherefore
didst
thou
weep
and
laugh
she
answered
this
calf
that
is
with
thee
is
the
son
of
our
master
the
merchant
and
the
wife
of
our
master
hath
enchanted
both
him
and
his
mother
and
this
was
the
reason
of
my
laughter
but
as
to
the
reason
of
my
weeping
it
was
on
account
of
his
mother
because
his
father
had
slaughtered
herâand
i
was
excessively
astonished
at
this
and
scarcely
was
i
certain
that
the
light
of
morning
had
appeared
when
i
hastened
to
inform
thee

the
herdsman
introducing
his
daughter
to
the
sheykh
when
i
heard
o
jinnee
the
words
of
the
herdsman
i
went
forth
with
him
intoxicated
without
wine
from
the
excessive
joy
and
happiness
that
i
received
and
arrived
at
his
house
where
his
daughter
welcomed
me
and
kissed
my
hand
and
the
calf
came
to
me
and
fawned
upon
me
and
i
said
to
the
herdsmans
daughter
is
that
true
which
thou
hast
said
respecting
this
calf
she
answered
yes
o
my45
master
he
is
verily
thy
son
and
the
vital
spirit
of
thy
heartâo
maiden
said
i
if
thou
wilt
restore
him
all
the
cattle
and
other
property
of
mine
that
thy
father
hath
under
his
care
shall
be
thine
upon
this
she
smiled
and
said
o
my
master
i
have
no
desire
for
the
property
unless
on
two
conditions
the
first
is
that
thou
shalt
marry
me
to
him
and
the
second
that
i
shall
enchant
her
who
enchanted
him
and
so
restrain
her
otherwise
i
shall
not
be
secure
from
her
artifice
on
hearing
o
jinnee
these
her
words
i
said
and
thou
shalt
have
all
the
property
that
is
under
the
care
of
thy
father
besides
and
as
to
my
cousin
even
her
blood
shall
be
lawful
to
thee
so
when
she
heard
this
she
took
a
cup
and
filled
it
with
water
and
repeated
a
spell
over
it
and
sprinkled
with
it
the
calf
saying
to
him
if
god
created
thee
a
calf
remain
in
this
form
and
be
not
changed
but
if
thou
be
enchanted
return
to
thy
original
form
by
permission
of
god
whose
name
be
exaltedâupon
which
he
shook
and
became
a
man
and
i
threw
myself
upon
him
and
said
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
relate
to
me
all
that
my
cousin
did
to
thee
and
to
thy
mother46
so
he
related
to
me
all
that
had
happened
to
them
both
and
i
said
to
him
o
my
son
god
hath
given
thee
one
to
liberate
thee
and
to
avenge
theeâand
i
married
to
him
o
jinnee
the
herdsmans
daughter
after
which
she
transformed
my
cousin
into
this
gazelle
and
as
i
happened
to
pass
this
way
i
saw
this
merchant
and
asked
him
what
had
happened
to
him
and
when
he
had
informed
me
i
sat
down
to
see
the
resultâthis
is
my
story
the
jinnee
said
this
is
a
wonderful
tale
and
i
give
up
to
thee
a
third
of
my
claim
to
his
blood

the
second
sheykh
the
owner
of
the
two
hounds
then
advanced
and
said
to
the
jinnee
if
i
relate
to
thee
the
story
of
myself
and
these
hounds
and
thou
find
it
to
be
in
like
manner
wonderful
wilt
thou
remit
to
me
also
a
third
of
thy
claim
to
the
blood
of
this
merchant
the
jinnee
answered
yes

the
story
of
the
second
sheykh
and
the
two
black
hounds

then
said
the
sheykh
know
o
lord
of
the
kings
of
the
jÃnn
that
these
two
hounds
are
my
brothers
my
father
died
and
left
to
us
three
thousand
pieces
of
gold21
and
i
opened
a
shop22
to
sell
and
buy
but
one
of
my
brothers
made
a
journey
with
a
stock
of
merchandise
and
was
absent
from
us
for
the
space
of
a
year
with
the
caravans
after
which
he
returned
destitute
i
said
to
him
did
i
not
advise
thee
to
abstain
from
travelling
but
he
wept
and
said
o
my
brother
god
to
whom
be
ascribed
all
might
and
glory
decreed
this
event
and
there
is
no
longer
any
profit
in
these
words
i
have
nothing
left
so
i
took
him
up
into
the
shop
and
then
went
with
him
to
the
bath
and
clad
him
in
a
costly
suit
of
my
own
clothing
after
which
we
sat
down
together
to
eat
and
i
said
to
him
o
my
brother
i
will
calculate
the
gain
of
my
shop
during
the
year
and
divide
it
exclusive
of
the
principal
between
me
and
thee
accordingly
i
made
the
calculation
and
found
my
gain
to
amount
to
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
i
praised
god
to
whom
be
ascribed
all
might
and
glory
and
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
divided
the
gain
in
two
equal
parts
between
myself
and
himâmy
other
brother
then
set
forth
on
a
journey
and
after
a
year
returned
in
the
like
condition
and
i
did
unto
him
as
i
had
done
to
the
former

the
second
sheykh
receiving
his
poor
brother
after
this
when
we
had
lived
together
for
some
time
my
brothers
again
wished
to
travel
and
were
desirous
that
i
should
accompany47
them
but
i
would
not
what
said
i
have
ye
gained
in
your
travels
that
i
should
expect
to
gain
they
importuned
me
but
i
would
not
comply
with
their
request
and
we
remained
selling
and
buying
in
our
shops
a
whole
year
still
however
they
persevered
in
proposing
that
we
should
travel
and
i
still
refused
until
after
the
lapse
of
six
entire
years
when
at
last
i
consented
and
said
to
them
o
my
brothers
let
us
calculate
what
property
we
possess
we
did
so
and
found
it
to
be
six
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
i
then
said
to
them
we
will
bury
half
of
it
in
the
earth
that
it
may
be
of
service
to
us
if
any
misfortune
befall
us
in
which
case
each
of
us
shall
take
a
thousand
pieces
with
which
to
traffic23
excellent
is
thy
advice
said
they
so
i
took
the
money
and
divided
it
into
two
equal
portions
and
buried
three
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
of
the
other
half
i
gave
to
each
of
them
a
thousand
pieces
we
then
prepared
merchandise
and
hired
a
ship
and
embarked
our
goods
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
for
the
space
of
a
whole
month
at
the
expiration
of
which
we
arrived
at
a
city
where
we
sold
our
merchandise
and
for
every
piece
of
gold
we
gained
ten

the
second
sheykh
finding
the
maiden
on
the
sea-shore
and
when
we
were
about
to
set
sail
again
we
found
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
a
maiden
clad
in
tattered
garments
who
kissed
my
hand
and
said
to
me
o
my
master
art
thou
possessed
of
charity
and
kindness
if
so
i
will
requite
thee
for
them
i
answered
yes
i
have
those
qualities
though
thou
requite
me
not
then
said
she
o
my
master
accept
me
as
thy
wife
and
take
me
to
thy
country
for
i
give
myself
to
thee24
act
kindly
towards
me
for
i
am
one
who
requires
to
be
treated
with
kindness
and
charity
and
who
will
requite
thee
for
so
doing
and
let
not
my
present
condition
at
all
deceive
thee
when
i
heard
these
words
my
heart
was
moved
with
tenderness
towards
her
in
order
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
purpose
of
god
to
whom
be
ascribed
all
might
and
glory
and
i
took
her
and
clothed
her
and
furnished
for
her
a
place
in
the
ship
in
a
handsome
manner
and
regarded
her
with
kind
and
respectful
attention

we
then
set
sail
and
i
became
most
cordially
attached
to
my
wife
so
that
on
her
account
i
neglected
the
society
of
my
brothers
who
in
consequence
became
jealous
of
me
and
likewise
envied
me
my
wealth
and
the
abundance
of
my
merchandise
casting
the
eyes
of
covetousness
upon
the
whole
of
the
property
they
therefore
consulted
together
to
kill
me
and
take
my
wealth
saying
let
us
kill
our
brother
and
all
the
property
shall
be
oursâand
the
devil
made
these
actions
to
seem
fair
in
their
eyes
so
they
came
to
me
while
i
was
sleeping
by
the
side
of
my
wife
and
took
both
of
us
up
and
threw
us
into
the
sea
but
as
soon
as
my
wife
awoke
she
shook
herself
and
became
transformed
into
a
jinneeyeh25
she
immediately
bore
me
away
and
placed
me
upon
an
island
and
for
a
while
disappeared
in
the
morning
however
she
returned
and
said
to
me
i
am
thy
wife
who
carried
thee
and
rescued
thee
from
death
by
permission
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
know
that
i
am
a
jinneeyeh
i
saw
thee
and
my
heart
loved
thee
for
the
sake
of
god
for
i
am
a
believer
in
god
and
his
apostle
god
bless
and
save
him26
i
came
to
thee
in
the
condition
in
which
thou
sawest
me
and
thou
didst
marry
me
and
see
i
have
rescued
thee
from
drowning
but
i
am
incensed
against
thy
brothers
and
i
must
kill
themâwhen
i49
heard
her
tale
i
was
astonished
and
thanked
her
for
what
she
had
doneâbut
said
i
as
to
the
destruction
of
my
brothers
it
is
not
what
i
desire
i
then
related
to
her
all
that
had
happened
between
myself
and
them
from
first
to
last
and
when
she
had
heard
it
she
said
i
will
this
next
night
fly
to
them
and
sink
their
ship
and
destroy
them
but
i
said
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
do
it
not
for
the
author
of
the
proverb
saith
o
thou
benefactor
of
him
who
hath
done
evil
the
action
that
he
hath
done
is
sufficient
for
him27âbesides
they
are
at
all
events
my
brothers
she
still
however
said
they
must
be
killedâand
i
continued
to
propitiate
her
towards
them
and
at
last
she
lifted
me
up
and
soared
through
the
air
and
placed
me
on
the
roof
of
my
house28

the
second
sheykh
saved
from
drowning
having
opened
the
doors
i
dug
up
what
i
had
hidden
in
the
earth
and
after
i
had
saluted
my
neighbours
and
bought
merchandise
i
opened
my
shop
and
in
the
following
night
when
i
entered
my
house
i
found
these
two
dogs
tied
up
in
it
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
they
came
to
me
and
wept
and
clung
to
me
but
i
knew
not
what
had
happened
until
immediately
my
wife
appeared
before50
me
and
said
these
are
thy
brothers
and
who
said
i
hath
done
this
unto
them
she
answered
i
sent
to
my
sister
and
she
did
it
and
they
shall
not
be
restored
until
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
and
i
was
now
on
my
way
to
her
that
she
might
restore
them
as
they
have
been
in
this
state
ten
years
when
i
saw
this
man
and
being
informed
of
what
had
befallen
him
i
determined
not
to
quit
the
place
until
i
should
have
seen
what
would
happen
between
thee
and
himâthis
is
my
storyâverily
said
the
jinnee
it
is
a
wonderful
tale
and
i
give
up
to
thee
a
third
of
the
claim
that
i
had
to
his
blood
on
account
of
his
offence

the
second
sheykh
and
the
two
black
hounds
upon
this
the
third
sheykh
the
owner
of
the
mule
said
to
the
jinnee29
as
to
me
break
not
my
heart
if
i
relate
to
thee
nothing
more
than
thisâ

the
story
of
the
third
sheykh
and
the
mule

the
mule
that
thou
seest
was
my
wife
she
became
enamoured
of
a
black
slave
and
when
i
discovered
her
with
him
she
took
a
mug
of
water
and
having
uttered
a
spell
over
it
sprinkled
me
and
transformed
me
into
a
dog
in
this
state
i
ran
to
the
shop
of
a
butcher
whose
daughter
saw
me
and
being
skilled
in
enchantment
restored
me
to
my
original
form
and
instructed
me
to
enchant
my
wife
in
the
manner
thou
beholdestâand
now
i
hope
that
thou
wilt
remit
to
me
also
a
third
of
the
merchants
offence
divinely
was
he
gifted
who
said

sow
good
even
on
an
unworthy
soil
for
it
will
not
be
lost
wherever
it
is
sown
when
the
sheykh
had
thus
finished
his
story
the
jinnee
shook51
with
delight
and
remitted
the
remaining
third
of
his
claim
to
the
merchants
blood
the
merchant
then
approached
the
sheykhs
and
thanked
them
and
they
congratulated
him
on
his
safety
and
each
went
his
way

but
this
said
shahrazÃd
is
not
more
wonderful
than
the
story
of
the
fisherman
the
king
asked
her
and
what
is
the
story
of
the
fisherman
and
she
related
it
as

remark

an
eastern
traveller
often
makes
a
long
journey
with
no
other
encumbrance
than
a
well-filled
pair
of
saddle-bags
in
one
bag
he
puts
his
provisions
and
in
the
other
such
articles
of
clothing
as
he
may
require
in
addition
to
those
in
which
he
sets
out
including
a
spare
shirt
and
perhaps
no
other
clean
linen
for
he
is
as
indifferent
with
regard
to
this
comfort
as
he
is
careful
respecting
his
personal
cleanliness

fate
and
destiny
the
belief
in
fate
and
destiny
el-áaáÃ

wa-l-áadar
exercises
a
most
powerful
influence
upon
the
actions
and
character
of
the
muslims
and
it
is
therefore
highly
important
that
the
reader
of
the
present
work
should
be
acquainted
with
the
notions
which
these
people
entertain
respecting
such
matters
of
faith
i
use
two
words
perhaps
the
best
that
our
language
affords
to
express
corresponding
arabic
terms
which
some
persons
regard
as
synonymous
but
others
distinguish
by
different
shades
of
meaning
on
what
i
consider
the
best
authority
the
word
which
i
render
fate
respects
the
decrees
of
god
in
a
general
sense
while
that
which
i
translate
destiny
relates
to
the
particular
applications
of
those
decrees
in
such
senses
these
terms
are
here
to
be
understood
when
separately
employed

many
muslims
hold
that
fate
is
in
some
respects
absolute
and
unchangeable
in
others
admitting
of
alteration
and
almost
all
of
them
act
in
many
of
the
affairs
of
life
as
if
this
were
their
belief
in
the
former
case
it
is
called
el-áaáÃ

el-moákam
in
the
latter
el-áaáÃ

el-mubram
which
term
without
the
explanation
here
given53
might
be
regarded
as
exactly
synonymous
with
the
former
hence
the
prophet
it
is
said
prayed
to
be
preserved
from
the
latter
as
knowing
that
it
might
be
changed
and
in
allusion
to
this
changeable
fate
god
we
are
told
says
god
will
cancel
what
he
pleaseth
and
confirm111
while
on
the
contrary
the
fate
which
is
termed
moákam
is
appointed
destiny
decreed
by
god112

many
doctors
have
argued
that
destiny
respects
only
the
final
state
of
a
certain
portion
of
men
believers
and
unbelievers
and
that
in
general
man
is
endowed
with
free
will
which
he
should
exercise
according
to
the
laws
of
god
and
his
own
conscience
and
judgment
praying
to
god
for
a
blessing
on
his
endeavours
or
imploring
the
intercession
of
the
prophet
or
of
any
of
the
saints
in
his
favour
and
propitiating
them
by
offering
alms
or
sacrifices
in
their
names
relying
upon
god
for
the
result
which
he
may
then
and
then
only
attribute
to
fate
or
destiny
they
hold
therefore
that
it
is
criminal
to
attempt
resistance
to
the
will
when
its
dictates
are
conformable
with
the
laws
of
god
and
our
natural
consciences
and
prudence
and
so
passively
to
await
the
fulfilment
of
gods
decreesâthe
doctrine
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
the
traditions
respecting
the
decrees
of
god
or
fate
and
destiny
appears
however
to
be
that
they
are
altogether
absolute
and
unchangeableâwritten
in
the
beginning
of
the
creation
on
the
preserved
tablet
in
heaven
that
god
hath
predestined
every
event
and
action
evil
as
well
as
good
at
the
same
time
commanding
and
approving
good
and
forbidding
and
hating
evil
and
that
the
cancelling
mentioned
in
the
preceding
paragraph
relates
as
the
context
seems
to
shew
to
the
abrogation
of
former
scriptures
or
revelations
not
of
fate
but
still
it
must
be
held
that
he
hath
not
predestined
the
will
though
he
sometimes
inclines
it
to
good
and
the
devil
sometimes
inclines
it
to
evil
it
is
asked
then
if
we
have
the
power
to
will
but
not
the
power
to
perform
otherwise
than
as
god
hath
predetermined
how
can
we
be
regarded
as
responsible
beings
the
answer
to
this
is
that
our
actions
are
judged
good
or
evil
according
to
our
intentions
if
we
have
faith
good
actions
or
intentions
it
should
be
added
only
increase
and
do
not
cause
our
happiness
if
we
are
believers
and
evil
actions
or
intentions
only
increase
our
misery
if
we
are
unbelievers
or
irreligious
for
the
muslim
holds
that
he
is
to
be
admitted
into
heaven
only
by
the
mercy
of
god
on
account
of
his
faith
and
to
be
rewarded
in
proportion
to
his
good
works

the
prophets
assertions
on
the
subject
of
gods
decrees
are
considered
of
the
highest
importance
as
explanatory
of
the
áur-Ãnâwhatever
is
in
the
universe
said
he
is
by
the
order
of
godâgod
hath
pre-ordained
five
things
on
his
servants
the
duration
of
life
their
actions
their
dwelling-places
their
travels
and
their
portionsâthere
is
not
one
among
you
whose
sitting-place
is
not
written
by
god
whether
in
the
fire
or
in
paradise113âsome
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
on
hearing
the
last-quoted
saying
asked
him
o
prophet
since
god
hath
appointed
our
places
may
we
confide
in
this
and
abandon
our
religious
and
moral
duties
he
answered
no
because
the
happy
will
do
good
works
and
those
who
are
of
the
miserable
will
do
bad
worksâthe
following
of
his
sayings
further
illustrate
this
subjectâwhen
god
hath
ordered
a
creature
to
die
in
any
particular
place
he
causeth
his
wants
to
direct
him
to
that
placeâa
companion
asked
o
prophet
of
god
inform
me
respecting
charms
and
the
medicines
which
i
swallow
and
shields
which
i
make
use
of
for
protection
whether
they
prevent
any
of
the
orders
of
god
moáammad
answered
these
also
are
by
the
order
of
god114
there
is
a
medicine
for
every
pain
then
when
the
medicine
reaches
the
pain
it
is
cured
by
the
order
of
god115âwhen
a
muslim
therefore
feels
an
inclination
to
make
use
of
medicine
for
the
cure
of
a
disease
he
should
do
so
in
the
hope
of
its
being
predestined
that
he
shall
be
so
cured

on
the
predestination
of
diseases
i
find
the
following
curious
quotation
and
remark
54in
a
manuscript
work
by
es-suyooáee
in
my
possessionâel-áaleemee
says
communicable
or
contagious
diseases
are
six
small-pox
measles
itch
or
scab
foul
breath
or
putridity
melancholy
and
pestilential
maladies
and
diseases
engendered
are
also
six
leprosy
hectic
epilepsy
gout
elephantiasis
and
phthisis
but
this
does
not
contradict
the
saying
of
the
prophet
there
is
no
transition
of
diseases
by
contagion
or
infection
nor
any
omen
that
brings
evil
for
the
transition
here
meant
is
one
occasioned
by
the
disease
itself
whereas
the
effect
is
of
god
who
causes
pestilence
to
spread
when
there
is
intercourse
with
the
diseased116âa
bedawee
asked
the
prophet
what
is
the
condition
of
camels
which
stay
in
the
deserts
verily
you
might
say
they
are
deer
in
health
and
in
cleanness
of
skin
then
they
mix
with
mangy
camels
and
they
become
mangy
also
moáammad
said
what
made
the
first
camel
mangy117

notwithstanding
however
the
arguments
which
have
been
here
adduced
and
many
others
that
might
be
added
declaring
or
implying
the
unchangeable
nature
of
all
gods
decrees
i
have
found
it
to
be
the
opinion
of
my
own
muslim
friends
that
god
may
be
induced
by
supplication
to
change
certain
of
his
decrees
at
least
those
regarding
degrees
of
happiness
or
misery
in
this
world
and
the
next
and
that
such
is
the
general
opinion
appears
from
a
form
of
prayer
which
is
repeated
in
the
mosques
on
the
eve
of
the
middle
or
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
of
shaáºbÃn
when
it
is
believed
that
such
portions
of
gods
decrees
as
constitute
the
destinies
of
all
living
creatures
for
the
ensuing
year
are
confirmed
and
fixed
in
this
prayer
it
is
said
o
god
if
thou
hast
recorded
me
in
thine
abode
upon
the
original
of
the
book
the
preserved
tablet
miserable
or
unfortunate
or
scanted
in
my
sustenance
cancel
o
god
of
thy
goodness
my
misery
and
misfortune
and
scanty
allowance
of
sustenance
and
confirm
me
in
thine
abode
upon
the
original
of
the
book
as
happy
and
provided
for
and
directed
to
good
c118

the
arabs
in
general
constantly
have
recourse
both
to
charms
and
medicines
not
only
for
the
cure
but
also
for
the
prevention
of
diseases
they
have
indeed
a
strange
passion
for
medicine
which
shows
that
they
do
not
consider
fate
as
altogether
unconditional
nothing
can
exceed
the
earnestness
with
which
they
often
press
a
european
traveller
for
a
dose
and
the
more
violent
the
remedy
the
better
are
they
pleased
the
following
case
will
serve
as
an
exampleâthree
donkey-drivers
conveying
the
luggage
of
two
british
travellers
from
boolÃá
to
cairo
opened
a
bottle
which
they
observed
in
a
basket
and
finding
it
to
contain
as
they
had
suspected
brandy
emptied
it
down
their
throats
but
he
who
had
the
last
on
turning
up
the
bottle
got
the
tail
of
a
scorpion
into
his
mouth
and
looking
through
the
bottle
to
his
great
horror
saw
that
it
contained
a
number
of
these
reptiles
with
tarantulas
vipers
and
beetles
thinking
that
they
had
poisoned
themselves
but
not
liking
to
rely
upon
fate
they
persuaded
a
man
to
come
to
me
for
medicine
he
introduced
the
subject
by
saying
o
efendee
do
an
act
of
kindness
there
are
three
men
poisoned
in
your
mercy
give
them
medicine
and
save
their
lives
and
then
he
related
the
whole
affair
without
concealing
the
theft
i
replied
that
they
did
not
deserve
medicine
but
he
urged
that
by
giving
it
i
should
obtain
an
immense
reward
yes
said
i
he
who
saveth
a
soul
alive
shall
be
as
if
he
had
saved
the
lives
of
all
mankind119
i
said
this
to
try
the
feeling
of
the
applicant
who
expressing
admiration
of
my
knowledge
urged
me
to
be
quick
lest
the
men
should
die
thus
showing
himself
to
be
no
unconditional
fatalist
i
gave
him
three
strong
doses
of
tartar
emetic
and
he
soon
came
back
to
thank
me
saying
that
the
medicine
was
most
admirable
for
the
men
had
hardly
swallowed
it
when
they
almost
vomited
their
hearts
and
livers
and
everything
else
in
their
bodies

from
a
distrust
in
faith
some
muslims
even
shut
themselves
up
during
the
prevalence
of
plague
but
this
practice
is
generally
condemned
a
syrian
friend
of
mine
who
did
55so
nearly
had
his
door
broken
open
by
his
neighbours
another
of
my
friends
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
ulamÃ

confessed
to
me
his
conviction
of
the
lawfulness
of
quarantine
and
argued
well
in
favour
of
it
but
said
that
he
dared
not
openly
avow
such
an
opinion
the
apostle
of
god
said
he
god
bless
and
save
him
hath
commanded
that
we
should
not
enter
a
city
where
there
is
pestilence
nor
go
out
from
it
why
did
he
say
enter
it
notâbecause
by
so
doing
we
should
expose
ourselves
to
the
disease
why
did
he
say
go
not
out
from
itâbecause
by
so
doing
we
should
carry
the
disease
to
others
the
prophet
was
tenderly
considerate
of
our
welfare
but
the
present
muslims
in
general
are
like
bulls
brute
beasts
and
they
hold
the
meaning
of
this
command
to
be
go
not
into
a
city
where
there
is
pestilence
because
this
would
be
rashness
and
go
not
out
from
it
because
this
would
be
distrusting
gods
power
to
save
you
from
it

many
of
the
vulgar
and
ignorant
among
modern
muslims
believe
that
the
unchangeable
destinies
of
every
man
are
written
upon
his
head
in
what
are
termed
the
sutures
of
the
skull

on

careful

to
be

slaves
a
slave
among
muslims
is
either
a
person
taken
captive
in
war
or
carried
off
by
force
and
being
at
the
time
of
capture
an
infidel

the
offspring
of
a
female
slave
by
another
slave
or
by
any
man
who
is
not
her
owner
or
by
her
owner
if
he
does
not
acknowledge
himself
to
be
the
father
but
the
offspring
of
a
male
slave
by
a
free
woman
is
free
a
person
who
embraces
the
mohammadan
faith
after
having
been
made
a
slave
does
not
by
this
act
become
free
unless
he
flees
from
a
foreign
infidel
master
to
a
muslim
country
and
there
becomes
a
mohammadan
a
person
cannot
have
as
a
slave
one
whom
he
acknowledges
to
be
within
the
prohibited
degrees
of
marriage121âthe
slaves
of
the
arabs
are
mostly
from
abyssinia
and
the
negro
countries
a
few
mostly
in
the
houses
of
wealthy
individuals
are
from
georgia
and
circassia

slaves
have
no
civil
liberty
but
are
entirely
under
the
authority
of
their
owners
56whatever
may
be
the
religion
sex
or
age
of
the
latter
and
can
possess
no
property
unless
by
the
owners
permission
the
owner
is
entire
master
while
he
pleases
of
the
person
and
goods
of
his
slave
and
of
the
offspring
of
his
female
slave
which
if
begotten
by
him
or
presumed
to
be
so
he
may
recognise
as
his
own
legitimate
child
or
not
the
child
if
recognised
by
him
enjoys
the
same
privileges
as
the
offspring
of
a
free
wife
and
if
not
recognised
by
him
is
his
slave
the
master
may
even
kill
his
own
slave
with
impunity
for
any
offence
and
he
incurs
but
a
slight
punishment
as
imprisonment
for
a
period
at
the
discretion
of
the
judge

he
kills
him
wantonly
he
may
give
away
or
sell
his
slaves
excepting
in
some
cases
which
will
be
mentioned
and
may
marry
them
to
whom
he
will
but
not
separate
them
when
married
a
slave
however
according
to
most
of
the
doctors
cannot
have
more
than
two
wives
at
the
same
time
unemancipated
slaves
at
the
death
of
their
master
become
the
property
of
his
heirs
and
when
an
emancipated
slave
dies
leaving
no
male
descendants
or
collateral
relations
the
former
master
is
the
heir
or
if
he
be
dead
his
heirs
inherit
the
slaves
property
as
a
slave
enjoys
less
advantages
than
a
free
person
the
law
in
some
cases
ordains
that
his
punishment
for
an
offence
shall
be
half
of
that
to
which
the
free
is
liable
to
the
same
offence
or
even
less
than
half
if
it
be
a
fine
or
pecuniary
compensation
it
must
be
paid
by
the
owner
to
the
amount
if
necessary

from

after

from

becomes

is
dissolved

complete
and
immediate
emancipation
is
sometimes
granted
to
a
slave
gratuitously
or
for
a
future
pecuniary
compensation

is
conferred
by
means
of
a
written
document

by

verbal
declaration
expressed
in

thou

some
similar
phrase
in

obtained
from

future
emancipation
is
sometimes
covenanted
to
be
granted
on
the
fulfilment
of
certain
conditions
and
more
frequently
to
be
conferred
on
the
occasion
of
the
owners
death
in
the
latter
case
the
owner
cannot
sell
the
slave
to
whom
he
has
made
this
promise
and
as
he
cannot
alienate
by
will
more
than
one-third
of
the
whole
property
that
he
leaves
the
law
ordains
that
if
the
value
of
the
said
slave
exceeds
that
portion
the
slave
must
obtain
and
pay
the
additional
sum
when
a
female
slave
has
borne
a
child
to
her
master
and
he
acknowledges
the
child
to
be
his
own
he
cannot
sell
this
slave
and
she
becomes
free
on
his
death

abyssinian
and
white
female
slaves
are
kept
by
many
men
of
the
middle
and
higher
classes
and
often
instead
of
wives
as
requiring
less
expense
and
being
more
subservient
but
they
are
generally
indulged
with
the
same
luxuries
as
free
ladies
their
vanity
is
gratified
by
costly
dresses
and
ornaments
and
they
rank
high
above
free
servants
as
do
also
the
male
slaves
those
called
abyssinians
appear
to
be
a
mixed
race
between
negroes
and
whites
and
are
from
the
territories
of
the
gallas
they
are57
mostly
kidnapped
and
sold
by
their
own
countrymen
the
negro
female
slaves
as
few
of
them
have
considerable
personal
attractions
which
is
not
the
case
with
the
abyssinians
many
of
whom
are
very
beautiful
are
usually
employed
only
in
cooking
and
other
menial
offices
the
female
slaves
of
the
higher
classes
are
often
instructed
in
plain
needlework
and
embroidery
and
sometimes
in
music
and
dancing
formerly
many
of
them
possessed
sufficient
literary
accomplishments
to
quote
largely
from
esteemed
poems
or
even
to
compose
extemporary
verses
which
they
would
often
accompany
with
the
lute
the
condition
of
many
concubine
slaves
is
happy
and
that
of
many
quite
the
contrary
these
and
all
other
slaves
of
either
sex
are
generally
treated
with
kindness
but
at
first
they
are
usually
importuned
and
not
unfrequently
used
with
much
harshness
to
induce
them
to
embrace
the
mohammadan
faith
which
almost
all
of
them
do
their
services
are
commonly
light
the
usual
office
of
the
male
white
slave
who
is
called
memlook
is
that
of
a
page
or
a
military
guard
eunuchs
are
employed
as
guardians
of
the
women
but
only
in
the
houses
of
men
of
high
rank
or
of
great
wealth
on
account
of
the
important
and
confidential
office
which
they
fill
they
are
generally
treated
in
public
with
especial
consideration
i
used
to
remark
in
cairo
that
few
persons
saluted
me
with
a
more
dignified
and
consequential
air
than
these
pitiable
but
self-conceited
beings
most
of
them
are
abyssinians
or
negroes
indeed
the
slaves
in
general
take
too
much
advantage
of
the
countenance
of
their
masters
especially
when
they
belong
to
men
in
power
the
master
is
bound
to
afford
his
slaves
proper
food
and
clothing
or
to
let
them
work
for
their
own
support
or
to
sell
give
away
or
liberate
them
it
is
however
considered
disgraceful
for
him
to
sell
a
slave
who
has
been
long
in
his
possession
and
it
seldom
happens
that
a
master
emancipates
a
female
slave
without
marrying
her
to
some
man
able
to
support
her
or
otherwise
providing
for
her

the
prophet
strongly
enjoined
the
duty
of
kindness
to
slaves
feed
your
memlooks
said
he
with
food
of
that
which
ye
eat
and
clothe
them
with
such
clothing
as
ye
wear
and
command
them
not
to
do
that
which
they
are
unable122âthese
precepts
are
generally
attended
to
either
entirely
or
in
a
great
degree
some
other
sayings
of
the
prophet
on
this
subject
well
deserve
to
be
mentioned
as
the
followingâhe
who
beats
his
slave
without
fault
or
slaps
him
on
the
face
his
atonement
for
this
is
freeing
himâa
man
who
behaves
ill
to
his
slave
will
not
enter
into
paradiseâwhoever
is
the
cause
of
separation
between
mother
and
child
by
selling
or
giving
god
will
separate
him
from
his
friends
on
the
day
of
resurrectionâwhen
a
slave
wishes
well
to
his
master
and
worships
god
well
for
him
are
double
rewards123âit
is
related
of
othmÃn
that
he
twisted
the
ear
of
a
memlook
belonging
to
him
on
account
of
disobedience
and
afterwards
repenting
of
it
ordered
him
to
twist
his
ear
in
like
manner
but
he
would
not
othmÃn
urged
him
and
the
memlook
advanced
and
began
to
wring
it
by
little
and
little
he
said
to
him
wring
it
hard
for
i
cannot
endure
the
punishment
of
the
day
of
judgment
on
account
of
this
act
the
memlook
answered
o
my
master
the
day
that
thou
fearest
i
also
fearâit
is
related
also
of
zeyn-el-Ãbideen
that
he
had
a
memlook
who
seized
a
sheep
and
broke
its
leg
and
he
said
to
him
why
didst
thou
this
he
answered
to
provoke
thee
to
anger
and
i
said
he
will
provoke
to
anger
him
who
taught
thee
and
he
is
iblees
go
and
be
free
for
the
sake
of
god124âmany
similar
anecdotes
might
be
added
but
the
general
assertions
of
travellers
in
the
east
are
more
satisfactory
evidence
in
favour
of
the
humane
conduct
of
most
muslims
to
their
slaves

it
sometimes
happens
though
rarely
that
free
girls
are
sold
as
slaves125
a
remarkable
instance
is
related
in
the
mir-Ãt
ez-zemÃn126âfÃáimeh
surnamed
ghareeb
a
slave
of
the
khaleefeh
el-moáºtaáim
the
son
of
hÃroon
was
a
poetess
accomplished
in
singing
and
calligraphy
and
extremely
beautiful
her
mother
was
an
orphan
and

58

jaáºfar
the
famous
wezeer
of
hÃroon
er-rasheed
took
her
as
his
wife
but
his
father
yaáyÃ

reproached
him
for
marrying
a
woman
whose
father
and
mother
were
unknown
and
he
therefore
removed
her
from
his
own
residence
to
a
neighbouring
house
where
he
frequently
visited
her
and
she
bore
him
a
daughter
the
above-mentioned
ghareeb
and
died
jaáºfar
committed
her
infant
to
the
care
of
a
christian
woman
to
nurse
and
on
the
overthrow
of
his
family
this
woman
sold
her
young
charge
as
a
slave
el-emeen
the
successor
of
er-rasheed
bought
her
of
a
man
named
sumbul
but
never
paid
her
price
and
when
he
was
killed
she
returned
to
her
former
master
but
on
the
arrival
of
el-ma-moon
at
baghdÃd
she
was
described
to
him
and
he
compelled
sumbul
to
sell
her
to
him
this
sumbul
loved
her
so
passionately
that
he
died
of
grief
at
her
loss
on
the
death
of
el-ma-moon
his
successor
el-moáºtaáim
bought
her
for
a
hundred
thousand
dirhems
and
emancipated
her
the
historian
adds
that
she
composed
several
well-known
airs
and
verses

note
14
an
arab
who
is
married
to
his
cousin
generally
calls
her
by
this
appellation
rather
than
that
of
wife
as
the
tie
of
blood
is
to
him
in
every
respect
stronger
than
that
of
matrimony

note
15âon
magic
the
arabs
and
other
mohammadans
enjoy
a
remarkable
advantage
over
us
in
the
composition
of
works
of
fiction
in
the
invention
of
incidents
which
we
should
regard
as
absurd
in
the
extreme
they
cannot
be
accused
by
their
countrymen
of
exceeding
the
bounds
of
probability
a
case
similar
to
that
here
described
was
related
to
me
as
a
fact
in
cairo
a
person
in
that
city
i
was
told
was
suddenly
surprised
by
the
disappearance
of
his
brother
and
by
finding
in
his
place
an
ass
but
this
animal
increased
his
astonishment
and
that
of
every
person
who
beheld
him
by
manifesting
a
sagacity
singularly
opposed
to
the
proverbial
dulness
of
the
generality
of
his
species
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
was
not
imagined
that
this
brute
was
the
lost
man
in
a
transformed
state
till
one
day
an
old
woman
seeing
him
quickly
covered
her
face
and
declared
the
fact
she
discovered
this
by
her
knowledge
of
magic
and
by
her
skill
in
this
art
she
agreed
to
restore
the
enchanted
person
to
his
proper
shape
having
collected
a
number
of
herbs
she
boiled
them
in
a
large
vessel
and
when
the
decoction
had
cooled
she
took
the
vessel
and
muttering
a
certain
spell
threw
its
contents
over
the
animal
endeavouring
to
do
so
in
such
a
manner
that
every
part
of
it
should
be
wetted
every
part
of
it
was
wetted
excepting
one
hind-foot
and
accordingly
it
was
restored
to
the
original
human
form
with
the
exception
of
one
foot
which
remained
like
that
of
an
ass

an
implicit
belief
in
magic
is
entertained
by
almost
all
muslims
and
he
among
them
who
denies
its
truth
they
regard
as
a
freethinker
or
an
infidel
some
are
of
opinion
that
it
ceased
on
the
mission
of
moáammad
but
these
are
comparatively
few
many
of
the
most
learned
muslims
to
the
present
age
have
deeply
studied
it
and
a
much
greater
number
of
persons
of
inferior
education
particularly
school-masters
have
more
or
less
devoted
their
time
and
talents
to
the
pursuit
of
this
knowledge
recourse
is
had
to
it
for
the
discovery
of
hidden
treasures
for
alchymical
purposes
for
the
acquisition
of
the
knowledge
of
futurity
to
procure
offspring
to
obtain
the
affection
of
a
beloved
object
to
effect
cures
to
guard
against
the
influence
of
the
evil
eye
to
afflict
or
kill
an
enemy
or
a
rival
and
to
attain
various
other
objects
of
desire

there
are
two
descriptions
of
magic
one
is
spiritual
and
regarded
by
all
but
freethinkers
as
true
the
other
natural
and
denounced
by
the
more
religious
and
enlightened
as
deceptive

i
spiritual
magic
which
is
termed
er-rooáÃnee
vulgo
rowáÃnee
chiefly
depends
upon
the
virtues
of
certain
names
of
god
and
passages
from
the
áur-Ãn
and
the
agency
of
angels
and

kinds

divine
magic
is
regarded
as
a
sublime
science
and
is
studied
only
by
good
men
and
practised
only
for
good
purposes
perfection
in
this
branch
of
magic
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
the
most
great
name
of
god
el-ism
el
aáºáºam
but
this
knowledge
is
imparted
to
none
but
the
peculiar
favourites
of
heaven
by
virtue
of
this
name
which
was
engraved
on
his
seal-ring
suleymÃn
or
solomon

to
his
dominion

to
the
presence
of
his
sovereign
in
jerusalem

throne
of
the
queen
of
sheba127
but
this
was
a
small
miracle
to
effect
by
such
means
for
by
uttering
this
name
a
man
may
even
raise
the
dead
other
names
of
the
deity
commonly
known
are
believed
to
have
particular
efficacies
when
uttered
or
written
as
also
are
the
names
of
the
prophet
and
angels
and
good
jinn
are
said
to
be
rendered
subservient
to
the
purposes
of
divine
magic
by
means
of
certain
invocations
of
such
names
and
invocations
together
with
words
unintelligible
to
the
uninitiated
in
this
science
passages
from
the
áur-Ãn
mysterious
combinations
of
numbers
and
peculiar
diagrams
and
figures
are
chiefly
composed
written
charms
employed
for
good
purposes
enchantment
when
used
for
benevolent
purposes
is
regarded
by
the
vulgar
as
a
branch
of
lawful
or
divine
magic

not
so
by
the
learned
and
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
science
of
divination

satanic
magic
as
its
name
implies
is
a
science
depending
on
the
agency
of
the
devil
and
the
inferior
evil
jinn
whose
services
are
obtained
by
means
similar
to
those
which
propitiate
or
render
subservient
the
good
jinn
it
is
condemned
by
the
prophet
and
all
good
muslims
and
only
practised
for
bad
purposesâenchantment
which
is
termed
es-seár
is
almost
universally
acknowledged
to
be
a
branch
of
satanic
magic
but
some
few
persons
assert
agreeably
with
several
tales
in
this
work
that
it
may
be
and
by
some
has
been
studied
with
good
intentions
and
practised
by
the
aid
of
good
jinn
consequently
that
there
is
such
a
science
as
good
enchantment
which
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
branch
of
divine
or
lawful
magic
the
metamorphoses
are
said
to
be
generally
effected
by
means
of
spells
or
invocations
to
jinn

by
the
sprinkling
of
water
or
dust

said
to

ways

paralyzed

irresistible
passion

certain
objects
others
again
rendered
demoniacs

some
transformed
into
brutes

the
evil
eye
is
believed
to
enchant

very
powerful
and
distressing
manner

acknowledged
even
by
the

and
death
are
often
attributed
to
its
influence

mostly
written

of
the
kind
above
described

worn
by
many
muslims

the
view
of
counteracting

preserving
from

for
the
same
purpose
many
ridiculous
ceremonies
are
practisedâdivination
which
is
termed
el-kihÃneh

pronounced
on
the
highest
authority
to
be
a
branch
of
satanic
magic
though
not
believed
to
be
so
by
all
muslims
according
to
an
assertion
of
the
prophet
what
a
fortune-teller
says
may
sometimes
be
true
because
one
of
the
jinn
steals
away

from

the

one
of
the
objects
for
which
divination
is
most
studiedâthe
mode

divination

by
some
supposed
to
be
effected
by
the
aid
of
evil

the
more
enlightened
of
the
muslims
regard
it
as
a
branch
of
natural
magic

curious
performances
of
this
kind
by
means
of
a
fluid

been
described

manners

modern
egyptians

quarterly
review131

there
are
certain
modes
of
divination
which
cannot
properly
be
classed
under
the
head
of
spiritual
magic
but
require
a
place
between
the
account
of
this
science
and
that
of
natural
magicâthe
most
important
of
these
branches
of
kihÃneh
is
astrology
which
is
called
ilm
en-nujoom
this
is
studied
by
many
muslims
in
the
present
day
and
its
professors
are
often
employed
by
the
arabs
to
determine
a
fortunate
period
for
laying
the
foundation
of
a
building
commencing
a
journey
c
but
more
frequently
by
the
persians
and
turks
the
prophet
pronounced
astrology
to
be
a
branch
of
magic132âanother
branch
of
kihÃneh
is
geomancy
called
áŒarb
er-raml
a
mode
of
divination
from
certain
marks
made
on
sand
whence
its
appellation
or
on
paper
and
said
to
be
chiefly
founded
on
astrologyâthe
science
called
ez-zijr
or
el-eyÃfeh
is
a
third
branch
of
kihÃneh
being
divination
or
auguration
chiefly
from
the
motions
and
positions
or
postures
of
birds
or
of
gazelles
and
other
beasts
of
the
chase
thus
what
was
termed
a
sÃneá
that
is
such
an
animal
standing
or
passing
with
its
right
side
towards
the
spectator
was
esteemed
among
the
arabs
as
of
good
omen
and
a
bÃreá
or
an
animal
of
this
kind
with
its
left
side
towards
the
spectator
was
held
as
inauspicious133âel-áiyÃfeh
under
which
term
are
included
chiromancy
and
its
kindred
sciences
is
a
fourth
branch
of
kihÃnehâetÂtefÃ-ul

the
taking
an
omen
particularly
a
good
one
from
a
name
or
words
accidentally
heard
or
seen
or
chosen
from
a
book
belongs
to
the
same
science
the
taking
a
fÃl
or
omen
from
the
áur-Ãn
is
generally
held
to
be
lawfulâvarious
trifling
events
are
considered
as
ominous
for
instance
a
suláÃn
quitting
his
palace
with
his
troops
a
standard
happened
to
strike
a
thureiyÃ

a
cluster
of
lamps
so
called
from
resembling
the
pleiades
and
broke
them
he
drew
from
this
an
evil
omen
and
would
have
relinquished
the
expedition
but
one
of
his
chief
officers
said
to
him
o
our
lord
thy
standards
have
reached
the
pleiadesâand
being
relieved
by
this
remark
he
proceeded
and
returned
victorious134âthe
interpretation
of
dreams
taáºbeer
el-menÃmÃt
must
also
be
classed
among
the
branches
of
this
science
according
to
the
prophet
it
is
the
only
branch
of
divination
worthy
of
dependance
good
dreams
said
he
are
one
of
the
parts
of
prophecy
and
nothing
else
of
prophecy
remains
good
dreams
are
from
god
and
false
dreams
from
the
devil
when
any
one
of
you
has
a
bad
dream
spit
three
times
over
your
left
shoulder
and
seek
protection
with
god
from
the
devil
thrice
and
turn
from
the
side
on
which
the
dream
was
to
the
other135
this
rule
is
observed
by
many
muslims
dreams
are
generally
so
fully
relied
upon
by
them
as
to
be
sometimes
the
means
of
deciding
contested
points
in
history
and
science
the
sight
in
a
dream
of
anything
green
or
white
or
of
water
is
considered
auspicious
anything
black

red
or

inauspiciousâthe

natural
magic
which
is
called
es-seemiyÃ

is
regarded
by
most
persons
of
the
more
enlightened
classes
of
muslims
as
altogether
a
deceptive
art
no
more
worthy
of
respect
than
legerdemain
but
it
seems
to
be
nearly
allied
to
enchantment
for
it
is
said
to
effect
in
appearance
the
most
wonderful
transformations
and
to
cause
the
most
extraordinary
visions
affecting
the
senses
and
imagination
in
a
manner
similar
to
opium
this
and
other
drugs
are
supposed
by
some
persons
to
be
the
chief
means
by
which
such
illusions
are
caused
and
perfumes
which
are
generally
burnt
in
these
performances
may
operate
in
a
similar
manner
as
such
things
are
employed
in
performances
of
the
kind
called
áŒarb
el-mendel
before
mentioned
these
feats
are
regarded
by
many
as
effected
by
natural
magic
notwithstanding
what
has
been
said
above
respecting
the
services
of
evil
jinn
being
procured
by
means
of
perfumesâalchymy
el-keemiyÃ

is
a
branch
of
natural
magic
it
is
studied
by
many
muslims
of
the
present
day
and
by
some
of
considerable
talents
and
attainments

the
most
celebrated
of
the
magicians
who
have
gained
notoriety
in
egypt
during
the
course
of
the
last
hundred
years
was
the
sheykh
aámad
áÃdoomeh
who
flourished
somewhat
more
than
sixty
years
agoâi
write
in
1837
several
persons
of
cairo
men
of
intelligence
and
of
good
education
have
related
to
me
various
most
marvellous
stories
of
his
performances
on
the
authority
of
eye-witnesses
whom
they
considered
veracious
but
a
more
credible
account
of
this
magician
i
have
found
in
the
work
of
an
excellent
historian
of
modern
egypt
this
author
mentions
the
sheykh
áÃdoomeh
as
an
aged
man
of
venerable
appearance
who
derived
his
origin
from
the
town
of
semennood
in
the
delta
and
who
acquired
a
very
great
and
extensive
celebrity
for
his
attainments
in
spiritual
and
natural
magic
and
for
holding
converse
face
to
face
with
jinn
and
causing
them
to
appear
to
other
persons
even
to
the
blind
as
men
acquainted
with
him
informed
the
historian
his
contemporaries
says
this
writer
entertained
various
opinions
respecting
him
but
among
them
a
famous
grammarian
and
general
scholar
the
sheykh
áasan
el-kafrÃwee
regarded
him
as
a
first-rate
saint
who
performed
evident
miracles
this
learned
man
pronouncing
as
such
the
effects
of
his
legerdemain
and
natural
magic
his
fame
he
describes
as
having
increased
until
he
was
induced
to
try
an
unlucky
experiment
a
memlook
chief
yoosuf
bey
saw
some
magic
characters
written
on
the
body
of
one
of
his
female
slaves
and
exasperated
by
jealousy
commanded
her
with
a
threat
of
instant
death
to
tell
him
who
had
done
this
she
confessed
that
a
woman
had
taken
her
to
the
sheykh
áÃdoomeh
and
that
he
had
written
this
charm
to
attract
to
her
the
beys
love
upon
hearing
this
he
instantly
sent
some
attendants
to
seize
the
magician
and
to
put
him
to
death
and
throw
him
into
the
nile
which
was
done138
but
the
manner
in
which
the
seizure
was
made
as
related
to
me
by
one
of
my
friends
deserves
to
be
mentioned
several
persons
one
after
another
endeavoured
to
lay
hold
upon
him
but
every
arm
that
was
stretched
forth
for
this
purpose
was
instantly
paralyzed
through
a
spell
muttered
by
the
magician
until
a
man
behind
him
thrust
a
gag
into
his
mouth
and
so
stopped
his
enchantments

of
the
stories
related
to
me
of
áÃdoomehs
miracles
the
following
will
serve
as
a
62specimenâin
order
to
give
one
of
his
friends
a
treat
he
took
him
to
the
distance
of
about
half
an
hours
walk
into
the
desert
on
the
north
of
cairo
here
they
both
sat
down
upon
the
pebbly
and
sandy
plain
and
the
magician
having
uttered
a
spell
they
suddenly
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
like
one
of
the
gardens
of
paradise
abounding
with
flowers
and
fruit-trees
of
every
kind
springing
up
from
a
soil
clothed
with
verdure
brilliant
as
the
emerald
and
irrigated
by
numerous
streamlets
of
the
clearest
water
a
repast
of
the
most
delicious
viands
and
fruits
and
wines
was
spread
before
them
by
invisible
hands
and
they
both
ate
to
satiety
taking
copious
draughts
of
the
various
wines
at
length
the
magicians
guest
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
again
in
the
pebbly
and
sandy
plain
with
áÃdoomeh
still
by
his
sideâthe
reader
will
probably
attribute
this
vision
to
a
dose
of
opium
or
some
similar
drug
and
such
i
suppose
to
have
been
the
means
employed
for
i
cannot
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
narrator
though
he
would
not
admit
such
an
explanation
regarding
the
whole
as
an
affair
of
magic
effected
by
the
operation
of
jinn
like
similar
relations
in
the
present
work

it
may
be
remarked
that
most
of
the
enchantments
described
in
this
work
are
said
to
be
performed
by
women
and
reputed
witches
appear
to
have
been
much
more
numerous
in
all
countries
than
wizards
this
fact
the
muslims
readily
explain
by
a
saying
of
their
prophetâthat
women
are
deficient
in
sense
and
religionâwhence
they
argue
that
they
are
more
inclined
than
men
to
practise
what
is
unlawful

note
16âon
the
two
grand
festivals
the
muslims
observe
two
grand
eeds
or
festivals
in
every
year
the
first
of
these
immediately
follows
ramaáÃn
the
month
of
abstinence
and
lasts
three
days
it
is
called
the
minor
festival
the
other
which
is
called
the
great
festival
commences
on
the
tenth
of
zu-l-áejjeh
the
day
when
the
pilgrims
halting
on
their
return
from
mount
arafÃt
to
mekkeh
in
the
valley
of
minÃ
vulgarly
called
munÃ

perform
their
sacrifice
the
observance
of
this
festival
also
continues
three
days
or
four

early
in
the
first
morning
on
each
of
these
festivals
the
muslim
is
required
to
perform
a
lustration
of
his
whole
person
as
on
the
mornings
of
friday
and
on
the
first
morning
of
the
minor
festival
he
should
break
his
fast
with
a
few
dates
or
some
other
light
food
but
on
the
great
festival
he
abstains
from
food
until
he
has
acquitted
himself
of
the
religious
duties
now
to
be
mentioned
soon
after
sunrise
on
the
first
day
of
each
festival
the
men
dressed
in
new
or
in
their
best
clothes
repair
to
the
mosque
or
to
a
particular
place
appointed
for
the
performance
of
the
prayers
of
the
eed
on
going
thither
they
should
repeat
frequently
god

most
greatâthis
on
the
minor
festival
they
should
do
inaudibly
on
the

aloud
the
congregation
having
assembled
repeat
the
prayers
of
two
rekahs
after
which
the
khaáeeb
recites

a
prayer

houses
friends
congratulate
and
embrace
one
another
generally
paying
visits
for
this
purpose
and
the
great
receive
visits
from
their
dependants
the
young
on
these
occasions
kiss
the
right
hand
of
the
aged
and
servants
or
dependants
do
the
same
to
their
masters
or
superiors
unless
the
latter
be
of
high
rank
in
which
case
they
kiss
the
end
of
the
hanging
sleeve
or
the
skirt
of
the
outer
garment
most
of
the
shops
are
closed
excepting
those
at
which
eatables
and
sweet
drinks
are
sold
but
the
streets
are
filled
with
people
in
their
holiday
clothes

on
the
minor
festival
which
as
it
terminates
an
arduous
fast
is
celebrated
with
more
rejoicing
than
the
other139
servants
and
other
dependants
receive
presents
of
new
articles
of
clothing
from
their
masters
or
patrons
and
the
servant
receives
presents
of
small
sums
of
money
from
his
masters
friends
whom
if
they
do
not
visit
his
master
he
goes
to
congratulate
as
well
as
from
any
former
master
to
whom
he
often
takes
a
63plateful
of
kaáks
these
are
sweet
cakes
or
biscuits
of
an
annular
form
composed
of
flour
and
butter
with
a
little
ajameeyeh
which
is
a
thick
paste
consisting
of
butter
honey
a
little
flour
and
some
spices
inside
they
are
also
often
sent
as
presents
on
this
occasion
by
other
people
another
custom
required
of
the
faithful
on
this
festival
is
the
giving
of
alms

on
the
great
festival
after
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
every
one
who
can
afford
it
performs
with
his
own
hand
or
by
that
of
a
deputy
a
sacrifice
of
a
ram
he-goat
cow
or
buffalo
or
she-camel
part
of
the
meat
of
which
he
eats
and
part
he
gives
to
the
poor
or
to
his
friends
or
dependants
the
ram
or
goat
should
be
at
least
one
year
old
the
cow
or
buffalo
two
years
and
the
camel
five
years
and
the
victim
should
not
have
any
considerable
mutilation
or
infirmity
a
cow
or
buffalo
or
a
camel
is
a
sufficient
sacrifice
for
seven
persons
the
clothes
which
were
put
on
new
at
the
former
festival
are
generally
worn
on
this
occasion
and
the
presents
which
are
given
to
servants
and
others
are
usually
somewhat
less

on
each
of
the
two
festivals
it
is
also
customary
especially
with
the
women
to
visit
the
tombs
of
relations
the
party
generally
take
with
them
a
palm-branch
and
place
it
broken
in
several
pieces
or
merely
its
leaves
upon
the
tomb
or
monument
or
some
instead
of
this
place
sweet
basil
or
other
flowers
they
also
usually
provide
themselves
with
sweet
cakes
bread
dates
or
some
other
kind
of
food
to
distribute
to
the
poor
but
their
first
duty
on
arriving
at
the
tomb
is
to
recite
the
fÃteáah
the
opening
chapter
of
the
áur-Ãn
or
to
employ
a
person
to
recite
previously
a
longer
chapter
generally
the
thirty-sixth
or
soorat
yÃ-seen
or
even
the
whole
of
the
book
or
sometimes
the
visiters
recite
the
fÃteáah
and
after
having
hired
a
person
to
perform
a
longer
recitation
go
away
before
he
commences
the
women
often
stay
all
the
days
of
the
festival
in
the
cemeteries
either
in
tents
or
in
houses
of
their
own
erected
there
for
their
reception
on
these
and
other
occasions
the
tent
of
each
party
surrounds
the
tomb
which
is
the
object
of
their
visit
in
the
outskirts
of
the
cemeteries
swings
and
whirligigs
are
erected
and
story-tellers
dancers
and
jugglers
amuse
the
populace

mode
of
slaughtering
of
animals
for
food
in
the
old
translation
the
sheykh
is
described
as
preparing
to
slaughter
the
cow
with
a
mallet
this
is
a
mistake
of
a
serious
nature
as
the
flesh
of
the
victim
if
so
killed
would
be
legally
unclean
the
muslims
are
required
to
slaughter
animals
for
food
in
a
particular
manner
sheep
goats
cows
or
bulls
and
buffaloes
must
be
killed
by
cutting
the
throat
at
the
part
next
the
head
or
any
other
part
dividing
the
windpipe
gullet
and
carotid
arteries
the
camel
is
to
be
slaughtered
by
stabbing
the
throat
at
the
part
next
the
breast
poultry
also
must
be
killed
by
cutting
the
throat
and
so
must
every
tame
animal
of
which
the
flesh
is
lawful
food
the
slaughterer
in
every
case
must
be
a
muslim
a
christian
or
a
jew
of
either
sex
on
commencing
the
operation
he
must
say
in
the
name
of
god
god
is
most
greatâor
at
least
in
the
name
of
godâbut
not
add
the
compassionate
the
mercifulâfor
an
obvious
reason
birds
or
beasts
of
the
chase
may
be
killed
by
an
arrow
a
dog
a
hawk
c
but
the
name
of
god
must
be
uttered
at
the
time
of
discharging
the
arrow
or
slipping
the
dog
c
when
the
beast
or
bird
is
not
killed
at
once
by
the
arrow
c
it
must
be
slaughtered
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
same
manner
as
sheep
and
poultry
the
law
as
well
as
humanity
requires

the
influence
of
eloquence
and
tales
upon
the
arabs
the
main
incident
upon
which
this
work
is
founded
the
triumph
of
the
fascination
of
the
tongue
over
a
cruel
and
unjust
determination
which
nothing
else
could
annul
might
be
regarded
by
persons
unacquainted
with
the
character
and
literature
of
the
arabs
as
a
contrivance
too
improbable
in
its
nature
but
such
is
not
the
case
perhaps
there
are
no
other
people
in
the
world
who
are
such
enthusiastic
admirers
of
literature
and
so
excited
by
romantic
tales
as
those
above
named
eloquence
with
them
is
lawful
magic
it
exercises
over
their
minds
an
irresistible
influence
i
swear
by
god
said
their64
prophet
verily
abuse
of
infidels
in
verse
is
worse
to
them
than
arrows140
this
of
course
alludes
to
arab
unbelievers

in
the
purest
or
heroic
age
of
arabic
literature
which
was
anterior
to
the
triumph
of
the
mohammadan
religion
the
conquest
which
the
love
of
eloquence
could
achieve
over
the
sanguinary
and
vindictive
feelings
of
the
arabs
was
most
remarkably
exemplified
in
the
annual
twenty
days
fair
of
okÃáº
or
okÃáh
respecting
this
fair
i
shall
here
insert
a
few
particulars
borrowed
from
an
author
who
is
at
present
devoting
talents
of
the
very
highest
order
to
the
study
and
illustration
of
the
history
and
literature
of
the
early
arabs
and
to
whose
conversation
and
writings
i
must
acknowledge
myself
indebted
for
most
valuable
information
which
will
often
be
of
great
utility
to
me
in
this
undertaking
as
well
as
in
every
branch
of
my
arabic
studies

the
fair
of
okÃáº
was
not
only
a
great
mart
opened
annually
to
all
the
tribes
of
arabia
but
it
was
also
a
literary
congress
or
rather
a
general
concourse
of
virtues
of
glory
and
of
poetry
whither
the
hero-poets
resorted
to
celebrate
their
exploits
in
rhyming
verse
and
peacefully
to
contend
for
every
kind
of
honour
this
fair
was
held
in
the
district
of
mekkeh
between
eá-áÃÃf
and
nakhleh
and
was
opened
at
the
new
moon
of
zu-l-áaáºdeh
that
is
to
say
at
the
commencement
of
a
period
of
three
sacred
months
during
which
all
war
was
suspended
and
homicide
interdicted
how
is
it
possible
to
conceive
that
men
whose
wounds
were
always
bleeding
who
had
always
acts
of
vengeance
to
execute
vengeances
to
dread
could
at
a
certain
epoch
impose
silence
upon
their
animosities
so
as
tranquilly
to
sit
by
a
mortal
enemy
how
could
the
brave
who
required
the
blood
of
a
father
a
brother
or
a
son
according
to
the
phraseology
of
the
desert
and
of
the
bible141
who
long
perhaps
had
pursued
in
vain
the
murdererâmeet
him
accost
him
peacefully
at
okÃáº
and
only
assault
with
cadences
and
rhymes
him
whose
presence
alone
seemed
to
accuse
him
of
impotence
or
cowardiceâhim
whom
he
was
bound
to
slay
under
pain
of
infamy
after
the
expiration
of
the
truce
in
fine
how
could
he
hear
a
panegyric
celebrating
a
glory
acquired
at
his
own
expense
and
sustain
the
fire
of
a
thousand
looks
and
yet
appear
unmoved
had
the
arabs
no
longer
any
blood
in
their
veins
during
the
continuance
of
the
fairâthese
questions
so
embarrassing

were
determined
to
a
great
degree
during
the
age
of
arab
paganism
in
a
manner
the
most
simple
and
most
refinedâat
the
fair
of
okÃáº
the
heroes
were
masked
or
veiledâin
the
recitations
and
improvisations
the
voice
of
the
orator
was
aided
by
that
of
a
rhapsodist
or
crier
who
was
stationed
near
him
and
repeated
his
words
there
is
a
similar
office
in
the
public
prayers
it
is
that
of
the
muballigh
transmitter
who
is
employed
to
repeat
in
a
loud
voice
what
is
said
in
a
lower
tone
by
the
imÃm
these
two
facts
have
been
revealed
to
me
by
the
same
manuscript
which
i
am
translating
and
upon
which
i
am
commenting
the
use
of
the
mask
or
veil
might
however
be
either
adopted
or
dispensed
with
ad
libitum
as
is
proved
by
the
narratives
of
a
great
number
of
quarrels
begun
and
ended
at
okÃáº
it
was
in
this
congress
of
the
arab
poets
and
almost
every
warriour
was
a
poet
at
the
age
which
i
am
considering
that
the
dialects
of
arabia
became
fused
into
a
magic
language
the
language
of
the
áejÃz
which
moáammad
made
use
of
to
subvert
the
world
for
the
triumph
of
moáammad
is
nothing
else
than
the
triumph
of
speech142âthe
áur-Ãn
is
regarded
by
the
arabs
as
an
everlasting
miracle
surpassing
all
others
appealing
to
the
understanding
of
every
generation
by
its
inimitable
eloquence
a
stronger
proof
of
the
power
of
language
over
their
minds
could
hardly
be
adduced
unless
it
be
their
being
capable
of
receiving
as
a
credible
fact
the
tradition
that
both
genii
and
men
were
attracted
by
the
eloquent
reading
of
david
when
he
recited
the
psalms
that
the
wild
beasts
and
the
birds
were
alike
fascinated
and
that
sometimes
there
were
borne
out
from
his
assembly
as
many
as
four
hundred
corpses
of
men
who
died
from
the
excessive
delight
with
which
he
thus
inspired
them143
it
may
be
added
65that
the
recitation
or
chanting
of
the
áur-Ãn
is
a
favourite
means
of
amusing
the
guests
at
modern
private
festivities

in
what
may
be
termed
the
middle
age
of
arabic
literature
commencing
from
the
triumph
of
the
mohammadan
religion
and
extending
to
the
foundation
of
the
empire
of
baghdÃd
the
power
of
eloquence
over
the
educated
classes
of
the
arabs
probably
increased
in
proportion
as
it
became
less
familiar
to
them
for
early
in
this
age
they
began
to
simplify
their
spoken
language
in
consequence
of
their
intercourse
with
strangers
who
could
not
generally
acquire
the
difficult
old
dialect
of
their
conquerors
this
therefore
then
began
to
be
confined
to
literary
compositions
that
such
a
change
took
place
at
this
period
appears
from
several
anecdotes
interspersed
in
arabic
works
the
khaleefeh
el-weleed
who
reigned
near
the
close
of
the
first
century
of
the
flight
the
son
of
abd-el-melik
spoke
so
corrupt
a
dialect
that
he
often
could
not
make
himself
understood
by
the
arabs
of
the
desert
a
ridiculous
instance
of
the
mistakes
occasioned
by
his
use
of
the
simplified
language
which
is
now
current
is
related
by
abu-l-fidÃ

the
same
author
adds
that
the
father
and
predecessor
of
this
prince
was
a
man
of
eloquence
and
that
he
was
grieved
by
the
corrupt
speech
of
his
son
which
he
considered
as
a
defect
that
incapacitated
him
to
be
a
future
ruler
of
the
arabs
as
they
were
still
great
admirers
of
purity
of
speech
though
so
large
a
proportion
of
them
spoke
a
corrupt
dialect
wherefore
he
sent
him
to
a
house
to
be
instructed
by
a
grammarian
but
after
the
youth
had
remained
there
a
long
time
he
returned
to
his
father
more
ignorant
than
before
vulgarisms
however
would
sometimes
escape
from
the
mouth
of
abd-el-melik
himself
yet
so
sensible
was
he
to
eloquence
that
when
a
learned
man
with
whom
he
was
conversing
elegantly
informed
him
of
an
error
of
this
kind
he
ordered
his
mouth
to
be
filled
with
jewels
these
said
his
courteous
admonisher
are
things
to
be
treasured
up
not
to
be
expendedâand
for
this
delicate
hint
he
was
further
rewarded
with
thirty
thousand
pieces
of
silver
and
several
costly
articles
of
apparel144âit
may
be
aptly
added
that
this
khaleefeh
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
an
unjust
monarch
and
as
he
thus
bore
some
slight
resemblance
to
our
shahriyÃr
so
was
he
reclaimed
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
by
means
somewhat
similar
being
one
night
unable
to
sleep
he
called
for
a
person
to
tell
him
a
story
for
his
amusement
o
prince
of
the
faithful
said
the
man
thus
bidden
there
was
an
owl
in
el-mÃáil
and
an
owl
in
el-baárah
and
the
owl
of
el-mÃáil
demanded
in
marriage
for
her
son
the
daughter
of
the
owl
of
el-baárah
but
the
owl
of
el-baárah
said
i
will
not
unless
thou
give
me
as
her
dowry
a
hundred
desolate
farms
that
i
cannot
do
said
the
owl
of
el-mÃáil
at
present
but
if
our
sovereign
may
god
whose
name
be
exalted
preserve
him
live
one
year
i
will
give
thee
what
thou
desirestâthis
simple
fable
sufficed
to
rouse
the
prince
from
his
apathy
and
he
thenceforward
applied
himself
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
his
station145

in
the
most
flourishing
age
of
arabic
poetry
and
general
literature
and
science
commencing
from
the
foundation
of
the
empire
of
baghdÃd
and
extending
to
the
conquest
of
egypt
by
the
osmÃnlee
turks
the
influence
of
eloquent
and
entertaining
language
upon
the
character
of
the
arab
sovereigns
was
particularly
exemplified
a
few
illustrative
anecdotes
may
here
be
inserted

it
is
related
by
el-aámaee
that
hÃroon
er-rasheed
at
a
grand
fÃªte
which
he
was
giving
ordered
the
poet
abu-l-atÃhiyeh
to
depict
in
verse
the
voluptuous
enjoyments
of
his
sovereign
the
poet
began
thusâ

live
long
in
safe
enjoyment
of
thy
desires
under
the
shadow
of
lofty

exclaimed
er-rasheed
and
what
next

may
thy
wishes
be
abundantly
fulfilled
whether
at
eventide
or
in
the
morning
well
again
said
the
khaleefeh
then
what
next

but
when
the
rattling
breath
struggles
in
the
dark
cavity
of
the
chest
then
shalt
thou
know
surely

that

of

for
imbecile
indeed
is
he
who
doth
not
so
yea

exclaimed
the
khaleefeh
on
hearing
these
verses
his
jealousy
was
roused
and
his
vengeance
soon
after
fell
heavily
upon
his
former
favourites147

one
of
the
khaleefehs
having
invited
the
poets
of
his
day
to
his
palace
a
bedawee
carrying
a
water-jar
to
fill
at
the
river
followed
them
and
entered
with
them
the
khaleefeh
seeing
this
poor
man
with
the
jar
on
his
shoulder
asked
him
what
brought
him
thither
he
returned
for
answer
these

seeing
that

had
girded
on
the

to

he

was
grossly
offensive

tale
to
which

may
be
illustrated
by
the
following
anecdote
which
was
related
to
me
by
a
persian
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
in
cairo
named
abu-l-áÃsim
a
native
of
geelÃn
then
superintendent
of
the
bÃshÃ
s
printing-office
at
boolÃá

one
of
this
persons
countrymen
whom
he
asserted
to
be
a
man
of
indubitable
veracity
was
sitting
on
the
roof
of
a
house
which
he
had
hired
overlooking
the
ganges
and
was
passing
the
closing
hour
of
the
day
according
to
his
usual
custom
smoking
his
persian
pipe
and
feasting
his
eyes
by
gazing
at
the
beautiful
forms
of
indian
maidens
bathing
in
the
river
when
he
beheld
among
them
one
so
lovely
that
his
heart
was
overpowered
with
desire
to
have
her
for
his
wife
at
nightfall
she
came
to
him
and
told
him
that
she
had
observed
his
emotion
and
would
consent
to
become
his
wife
but
on
the
condition
that
he
should
never
admit
another
female
to
take
or
share
her
place
and
that
she
should
only
be
with
him
in
the
night-time
they
took
the
marriage-vow
to
each
other
with
none
for
their
witness
but
god
and
great
was
his
happiness
till
one
evening
he
saw
again
among
a
group
of
girls
in
the
river
another
who
excited
in
him
still
more
powerful
emotions
to
his
surprise
this
very
form
stood
before
him
at
the
approach
of
night
he
withstood
the
temptation
mindful
of
his
marriage-vow
she
used
every
allurement
but
he
was
resolute
his
fair
visiter
then
told
him
that
she
was
his
wife
that
she
was
a
jinneeyeh
and
that
she
would
always
thenceforward
visit
him
in
the
form
of
any
female
whom
he
might
chance
to
prefer

benediction
is
almost
always

of

and
often
also
in

must

observed

to
which
the

the
story
of
the
fisherman

there
was
a
certain
fisherman
advanced
in
age
who
had
a
wife
and
three
children
and
though
he
was
in
indigent
circumstances
it
was
his
custom
to
cast
his
net
every
day
no
more
than
four
times
one
day
he
went
forth
at
the
hour
of
noon
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
and
put
down
his
basket
and
cast
his
net
and
waited
until
it
was
motionless
in
the
water
when
he
drew
together
its
strings
and
found
it
to
be
heavy
he
pulled
but
could
not
draw
it
up
so
he
took
the
end
of
the
cord
and
knocked
a
stake
into
the
shore
and
tied
the
cord
to
it
he
then
stripped
himself
and
dived
round
the
net
and
continued
to
pull
until
he
drew
it
out
whereupon
he
rejoiced
and
put
on
his
clothes
but
when
he
came
to
examine
the
net
he
found
in
it
the
carcass
of
an
ass
at
the
sight
of
this
he
mourned
and70
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
this
is
a
strange
piece
of
fortuneâand
he
repeated
the
following
verseâ

o
thou
who
occupiest
thyself
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
in
peril
spare
thy
trouble
for
the
support
of
providence
is
not
obtained
by
toil1
he
then
disencumbered
his
net
of
the
dead
ass
and
wrung
it
out
after
which
he
spread
it
and
descended
into
the
sea
andâexclaiming
in
the
name
of
godâcast
it
again
and
waited
till
it
had
sunk
and
was
still
when
he
pulled
it
and
found
it
more
heavy
and
more
difficult
to
raise
than
on
the
former
occasion
he
therefore
concluded
that
it
was
full
of
fish
so
he
tied
it
and
stripped
and
plunged
and
dived
and
pulled
until
he
raised
it
and
drew
it
upon
the
shore
when
he
found
in
it
only
a
large
jar
full
of
sand
and
mud
on
seeing
which
he
was
troubled
in
his
heart
and
repeated
the
following
words
of
the
poetâ

o
angry
fate
forbear
or
if
thou
wilt
not
forbear
relent
neither
favour
from
fortune
do
i
gain
nor
profit
from
the
work
of
my
hands
i
came
forth
to
seek
my
sustenance
but
have
found
it
to
be
exhausted
how
many
of
the
ignorant
are
in
splendour
and
how
many
of
the
wise
in
obscurity
so
saying
he
threw
aside
the
jar
and
wrung
out
and
cleansed
his
net
and
begging
the
forgiveness
of
god
for
his
impatience
returned
to
the
sea
the
third
time
and
threw
the
net
and
waited
till
it
had
sunk
and
was
motionless
he
then
drew
it
out
and
found
in
it
a
quantity
of
broken
jars
and
pots

upon
this
he
raised
his
head
towards
heaven
and
said
o
god
thou
knowest
that
i
cast
not
my
net
more
than
four
times
and
i
have
now
cast
it
three
times
thenâexclaiming
in
the
name
of
godâhe
cast
the
net
again
into
the
sea
and
waited
till
it
was
still
when
he
attempted
to
draw
it
up
but
could
not
for
it
clung
to
the
bottom
and
he
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
godâand
stripped
himself
again
and
dived
round
the
net
and
pulled
it
until
he
raised
it
upon
the
shore
when
he
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
bottle2
of
brass
filled
with
something
and
having
its
mouth
closed
with
a
stopper
of
lead
bearing
the
impression
of
the
seal
of
our
lord
suleymÃn3
at
the
sight
of
this
the
fisherman
was
rejoiced
and
said
this
i
will
sell
in
the
copper-market
for
it
is
worth
ten
pieces
of
gold
he
then
shook
it
and
found
it
to
be
heavy
and
said
i
must
open
it
and
see
what
is
in
it
and
store
it
in
my
bag
and
then
i
will
sell
the
bottle
in
the
copper-market
so
he
took
out
a
knife
and
picked71
at
the
lead
until
he
extracted
it
from
the
bottle
he
then
laid
the
bottle
on
the
ground
and
shook
it
that
its
contents
might
pour
out
but
there
came
forth
from
it
nothing
but
smoke
which
ascended
towards
the
sky
and
spread
over
the
face
of
the
earth
at
which
he
wondered
excessively
and
after
a
little
while
the
smoke
collected
together
and
was
condensed
and
then
became
agitated
and
was
converted
into
an
efreet
whose
head
was
in
the
clouds
while
his
feet
rested
upon
the
ground4
his
head
was
like
a
dome
his
hands
were
like
winnowing
forks5
and
his
legs
like
masts
his
mouth
resembled
a
cavern
his
teeth
were
like
stones
his
nostrils
like
trumpets6
and
his
eyes
like
lamps
and
he
had
dishevelled
and
dust-coloured
hair

72

the
efreet
liberated
from
the
bottle
when
the
fisherman
beheld
this
efreet
the
muscles
of
his
sides
quivered
his
teeth
were
locked
together
his
spittle
dried
up
and
he
saw
not
his
way
the
efreet
as
soon
as
he
perceived
him
exclaimed
there
is
no
deity
but

said

the
fisherman
dost

he
answered
of
thy
being
instantly

to
a
most
cruel
death
the
fisherman
exclaimed
thou
deservest
for
this
news
o
master
of
the
efreets
the
withdrawal
of
protection
from
thee
o
thou
remote8
wherefore
wouldst
thou
kill
me
and
what
requires
thy
killing
me
when
i
have
liberated
thee
from
the
bottle
and
rescued
thee
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
brought

of
death

and
in
what
manner

shalt

offence
said
the
fisherman
that
this
should
be
my
recompense
from
thee

said
he
that

heretical

i
rebelled
against

and
he
sent
to
me
his
wezeer
Ãáaf
the
son
of
barkhiyÃ

who
came
upon
me
forcibly
and
took
me
to
him
in
bonds
and
placed
me
before
him
and
when
suleymÃn
saw
me
he
offered
up
a
prayer
for
protection
against
me
and
exhorted
me
to
embrace
the
faith
and
to
submit
to
his
authority
but
i
refused
upon
which
he
called
for
this
bottle
and
confined
me
in
it
and
closed
it
upon
me
with
the
leaden
stopper
which
he
stamped
with
the
most
great
name
he
then
gave
orders
to
the
jinn
who
carried
me
away
and
threw
me
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
there
i
remained
a
hundred
years
and
i
said
in
my
heart
whosoever
shall

me
i
will

him

the
hundred
years

wantsâbut
still
no
one
liberated
me
i
then
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
said
within
myself
whosoever
shall
liberate
me
now
i
will
kill
him
and
only
suffer
him
to
choose
in
what
manner
he
will
die
and
lo
now
thou
hast
liberated
me
and
i
have
given
thee
thy
choice
of
the
manner
in
which
thou
wilt
die

the
fisherman
enclosing
the
efreet
in
the
bottle
when
the
fisherman
had
heard
the
story
of
the
efreet
he
exclaimed
o
allah
that
i
should
not
have
liberated
thee
but
in
such
a
time
as
this
then
said
he
to
the
efreet
pardon
me
and
kill
me
not
and
so
may
god
pardon
thee
and
destroy
me
not
lest
god
give
power
over
thee
to
one
who
will
destroy
thee
the
mÃrid
answered
i
must
positively
kill
thee
therefore
choose
by
what
manner
of
death
thou
wilt
die
the
fisherman
then
felt
assured
of
his
death
but
he
again
implored
the
efreet
saying
pardon
me
by
way
of
gratitude
for
my
liberating
theeâwhy
answered
the
efreet
i
am
not
going
to
kill
thee
but
for
that
very
reason
because
thou
hast
liberated
meâo
sheykh
of
the
efreets
said
the
fisherman
do
i
act
kindly
towards
thee
and
dost
thou
recompense
me
with
baseness
but
the
proverb
lieth
not
that
saithâ

we
did
good
to
them
and
they
returned
us
the
contrary
and
such
by
my
life
is
the
conduct
of
the
wicked
thus
he
who
acteth
kindly
to
the
undeserving
is
recompensed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
aider
of
umm-Ãmir10
the
efreet
when
he
heard
these
words
answered
by
saying
covet
not
life
for
thy
death
is
unavoidable
then
said
the
fisherman
within
himself
this
is
a
jinnee
and
i
am
a
man
and
god
hath
given
me
sound
reason
therefore
i
will
now
plot
his
destruction
with
my
art
and
reason
like
as
he
hath
plotted
with
his
cunning
and
perfidy
so
he
said
to
the
efreet
hast
thou
determined
to
kill
me
he
answered
yes
then
said
he
by
the
most
great
name
engraved
upon
the
seal
of
suleymÃn
i
will
ask
thee
one
question
and
wilt
thou
answer
it
to
me
truly
on
hearing
the
mention
of
the
most
great
name
the
efreet
was
agitated
and
trembled
and
replied
yes
ask
and
be
brief
the
fisherman
then
said
how
wast
thou
in
this
bottle
it
will
not
contain
thy
hand
or
thy
foot
how
then
can
it
contain
thy
whole
bodyâdost
thou
not
believe
that
i
was
in
it
said
the
efreet
the
fisherman
answered
i
will
never
believe
thee
until
i
see
thee
in
it
upon
this
the
efreet
shook
and
became
converted
again
into
smoke
which
rose
to
the
sky
and
then
became
condensed
and
entered
the
bottle
by
little
and
little
until
it
was
all
enclosed
when
the
fisherman74
hastily
snatched
the
sealed
leaden
stopper
and
having
replaced
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
called
out
to
the
efreet
and
said
choose
in
what
manner
of
death
thou
wilt
die
i
will
assuredly
throw
thee
here
into
the
sea
and
build
me
a
house
on
this
spot
and
whosoever
shall
come
here
i
will
prevent
his
fishing
in
this
place
and
will
say
to
him
here
is
an
efreet
who
to
any
person
that
liberates
him
will
propose
various
kinds
of
death
and
then
give
him
his
choice
of
one
of
them
on
hearing
these
words
of
the
fisherman
the
efreet
endeavoured
to
escape
but
could
not
finding
himself
restrained
by
the
impression
of
the
seal
of
suleymÃn
and
thus
imprisoned
by
the
fisherman
as
the
vilest
and
filthiest
and
least
of
efreets
the
fisherman
then
took
the
bottle
to
the
brink
of
the
sea
the
efreet
exclaimed
nay
nayâto
which
the
fisherman
answered
yea
without
fail
yea
without
fail
the
mÃrid
then
addressing
him
with
a
soft
voice
and
humble
manner
said
what
dost
thou
intend
to
do
with
me
o
fisherman
he
answered
i
will
throw
thee
into
the
sea
and
if
thou
hast
been
there
a
thousand
and
eight
hundred
years
i
will
make
thee
to
remain
there
until
the
hour
of
judgment
did
i
not
say
to
thee
spare
me
and
so
may
god
spare
thee
and
destroy
me
not
lest
god
destroy
thee
but
thou
didst
reject
my
petition
and
wouldest
nothing
but75
treachery
therefore
god
hath
caused
thee
to
fall
into
my
hand
and
i
have
betrayed
theeâopen
to
me
said
the
efreet
that
i
may
confer
benefits
upon
thee
the
fisherman
replied
thou
liest
thou
accursed
i
and
thou
are
like
the
wezeer
of
king
yoonÃn11
and
the
sage
doobÃn12âwhat
said
the
efreet
was
the
case
of
the
wezeer
of
king
yoonÃn
and
the
sage
doobÃn
and
what
is
their
story
the
fisherman
answered
as
followsâ

the
story
of
king
yoonÃn
and
the
sage
doobÃn

know
o
efreet
that
there
was
in
former
times
in
the
country
of
the
persians13
a
monarch
who
was
called
king
yoonÃn
possessing
great
treasures
and
numerous
forces
valiant
and
having
troops
of
every
description
but
he
was
afflicted
with
leprosy
which
the
physicians
and
sages
had
failed
to
remove
neither
their
potions
nor
powders
nor
ointments
were
of
any
benefit
to
him
and
none
of
the
physicians
was
able
to
cure
him
at
length
there
arrived
at
the
city
of
this
king
a
great
sage
stricken
in
years
who
was
called
the
sage
doobÃn
he
was
acquainted
with
ancient
greek
persian
modern
greek
arabic
and
syriac
books
and
with
medicine
and
astrology
both
with
respect
to
their
scientific
principles
and
the
rules
of
their
practical
applications
for
good
and
evil
as
well
as
the
properties
of
plants
dried
and
fresh
the
injurious
and
the
useful
he
was
versed
in
the
wisdom
of
the
philosophers
and
embraced
a
knowledge
of
all
the
medical
and
other
sciences

after
this
sage
had
arrived
in
the
city
and
remained
in
it
a
few
days
he
heard
of
the
case
of
the
king
of
the
leprosy
with
which
god
had
afflicted
him
and
that
the
physicians
and
men
of
science
had
failed
to
cure
him
in
consequence
of
this
information
he
passed
the
next
night
in
deep
study
and
when
the
morning
came
and
diffused
its
light
and
the
sun
saluted
the
ornament
of
the
good14
he
attired
himself
in
the
richest
of
his
apparel
and
presented
himself
before
the
king
having
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
offered
up
a
prayer
for
the
continuance
of
his
power
and
happiness
and
greeted
him
in
the
best
manner
he
was
able
he
informed
him
who
he
was
and
said
o
king
i
have
heard
of
the
disease
which
hath
attacked
thy
person
and
that
many
of
the
physicians
are
unacquainted
with
the
means
of
removing
it
and
i
will
cure
thee
without
giving
thee
to
drink
any
potion
or
anointing
thee
with
ointment
when
king
yoonÃn
heard76
his
words
he
wondered
and
said
to
him
how
wilt
thou
do
this
by
allah
if
thou
cure
me
i
will
enrich
thee
and
thy
childrens
children
and
i
will
heap
favours
upon
thee
and
whatever
thou
shalt
desire
shall
be
thine
and
thou
shalt
be
my
companion
and
my
friendâhe
then
bestowed
upon
him
a
robe
of
honour15
and
other
presents
and
said
to
him
wilt
thou
cure
me
of
this
disease
without
potion
or
ointment
he
answered
yes
i
will
cure
thee
without
any
discomfort
to
thy
person
and
the
king
was
extremely
astonished
and
said
o
sage
at
what
time
and
on
what
day
shall
that
which
thou
hast
proposed
to
me
be
done
hasten
it
o
my
sonâhe
answered
i
hear
and
obey

he
then
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king
and
hired
a
house
in
which
he
deposited
his
books
and
medicines
and
drugs
having
done
this
he
selected
certain
of
his
medicines
and
drugs
and
made
a
goff-stick
with
a
hollow
handle
into
which
he
introduced
them
after
which
he
made
a
ball
for
it
skilfully
adapted
and
on
the
following
day
after
he
had
finished
these
he
went
again
to
the
king
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
directed
him
to
repair
to
the
horse-course
and
to
play
with
the
ball
and
goff-stick
the
king
attended
by
his
emeers
and
chamberlains
and
wezeers
went
thither
and
as
soon
as
he
arrived
there
the
sage
doobÃn
presented
himself
before
him
and
handed
to
him
the
goff-stick
saying
take
this
goff-stick
and
grasp
it
thus
and
ride
along
the
horse-course
and
strike
the
ball
with
it
with
all
thy
force
until
the
palm
of
thy
hand
and
thy
whole
body
become
moist
with
perspiration
when
the
medicine
will
penetrate
into
thy
hand
and
pervade
thy
whole
body
and
when
thou
hast
done
this
and
the
medicine
remains
in
thee
return
to77
thy
palace
and
enter
the
bath16
and
wash
thyself
and
sleep
then
shalt
thou
find
thyself
cured
and
peace
be
on
thee
so
king
yoonÃn
took
the
goff-stick
from
the
sage
and
grasped
it
in
his
hand
and
mounted
his
horse
and
the
ball
was
thrown
before
him
and
he
urged
his
horse
after
it
until
he
overtook
it
when
he
struck
it
with
all
his
force
and
when
he
had
continued
this
exercise
as
long
as
was
necessary
and
bathed
and
slept
he
looked
upon
his
skin
and
not
a
vestige
of
the
leprosy
remained
it
was
clear
as
white
silver
upon
this
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
his
heart
was
dilated
and
he
was
full
of
happiness

king
yoonÃn
playing
at
goff
on
the
following
morning
he
entered
the
council-chamber
and
sat
upon
his
throne
and
the
chamberlains
and
great
officers
of
his
court
came
before
him
the
sage
doobÃn
also
presented
himself
and
when
the
king
saw
him
he
rose
to
him
in
haste
and
seated
him
by
his
side
services
of
food
were
then
spread
before
them
and
the
sage
ate
with
the
king
and
remained
as
his
guest
all
the
day17
and
when
the
night
approached
the
king
gave
him
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
besides
dresses
of
honour
and
other
presents
and
mounted
him
on
his
own
horse
and
so
the
sage
returned
to
his
house18
and
the
king
was
astonished
at
his
skill
saying
this
man
hath
cured
me
by
an
external
process
without
anointing
me
with
ointment
by
allah
this
is
consummate
science
and
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
bestow
favours
and
honours
upon
him
and
to
make
him
my
companion
and
familiar
friend
as
long
as
i
live
he
passed
the
night
happy
and
joyful
on
account
of
his
recovery
and
when
he
arose
he
went
forth
again
and
sat
upon
his
throne
the
officers
of
his
court
standing
before
him
and
the
emeers
and
wezeers
sitting
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
he
called
for
the
sage
doobÃn
who
came
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
the
king
rose
and
seated
him
by
his
side
and
ate
with
him
and
greeted
him
with
compliments
he
bestowed
upon
him
again
a
robe
of
honour
and
other
presents
and
after
conversing
with
him
till
the
approach
of
night
gave
orders
that
five
other
robes
of
honour
should
be
given
to
him
and
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
the
sage
departed
and
returned
to
his
house

doobÃn
in
his
dress
of
honour
again
when
the
next
morning
came
the
king
went
as
usual
to
his
council-chamber
and
the
emeers
and
wezeers
and
chamberlains
surrounded
him
now
there
was
among
his
wezeers
one
of
ill
aspect
and
of
evil
star19
sordid
avaricious
and
of
an
envious
and
malicious
disposition
and
when
he
saw
that
the
king
had
made
the
sage
doobÃn
his
friend
and
bestowed
upon
him
these
favours
he78
envied
him
this
distinction
and
meditated
evil
against
him
agreeably
with
the
adage
which
saith
there
is
no
one
void
of
envy20âand
another
which
saith
tyranny
lurketh
in
the
soul
power
manifesteth
it
and
weakness
concealeth
it
so
he
approached
the
king
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
said
o
king
of
the
age
thou
art
he
whose
goodness
extendeth
to
all
men
and
i
have
an
important
piece
of
advice
to
give
thee
if
i
were
to
conceal
it
from
thee
i
should
be
a
base-born
wretch
therefore
if
thou
order
me
to
impart
it
i
will
do
so
the
king
disturbed
by
these
words
of
the
wezeer
said
what
is
thy
advice
he
answered
o
glorious
king
it
hath
been
said
by
the
ancients
he
who
looketh
not
to
results
fortune
will
not
attend
himânow
i
have
seen
the
king
in
a
way
that
is
not
right
since
he
hath
bestowed
favours
upon
his
enemy
and
upon
him
who
desireth
the
downfall
of
his
dominion
he
hath
treated
him
with
kindness
and
honoured
him
with
the
highest
honours
and
admitted
him
to
the79
closest
intimacy
i
therefore
fear
for
the
king
the
consequence
of
this
conductâat
this
the
king
was
troubled
and
his
countenance
changed
and
he
said
who
is
he
whom
thou
regardest
as
mine
enemy
and
to
whom
i
shew
kindness
he
replied
o
king
if
thou
hast
been
asleep
awake
i
allude
to
the
sage
doobÃnâthe
king
said
he
is
my
intimate
companion
and
the
dearest
of
men
in
my
estimation
for
he
restored
me
by
a
thing
that
i
merely
held
in
my
hand
and
cured
me
of
my
disease
which
the
physicians
were
unable
to
remove
and
there
is
not
now
to
be
found
one
like
to
him
in
the
whole
world
from
west
to
east
wherefore
then
dost
thou
utter
these
words
against
him
i
will
from
this
day
appoint
him
a
regular
salary
and
maintenance
and
give
him
every
month
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
if
i
gave
him
a
share
of
my
kingdom
it
were
but
a
small
thing
to
do
unto
him
i
do
not
think
that
thou
hast
said
this
from
any
other
motive
than
that
of
envy
if
i
did
what
thou
desirest
i
should
repent
after
it
as
the
man
repented
who
killed
his
parrot21

the
intelligent
parrot
the
story
of
the
husband
and
the
parrot

there
was
a
certain
merchant
of
an
excessively
jealous
disposition
having
a
wife
endowed
with
perfect
beauty
who
had
prevented
him
from
leaving
his
home
but
an
event
happened
which
obliged
him
to
make
a
journey
and
when
he
found
his
doing
so
to
be
indispensable
he
went
to
the
market
in
which
birds
were
sold
and
bought
a
parrot
which
he
placed
in
his
house
to
act
as
a
spy
that
on
his
return
she
might
inform
him
of
what
passed
during
his
absence
for80
this
parrot
was
cunning
and
intelligent
and
remembered
whatever
she
heard22
so
when
he
had
made
his
journey
and
accomplished
his
business
he
returned
and
caused
the
parrot
to
be
brought
to
him
and
asked
her
respecting
the
conduct
of
his
wife
she
answered
thy
wife
has
a
lover
who
visited
her
every
night
during
thy
absenceâand
when
the
man
heard
this
he
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
went
to
his
wife
and
gave
her
a
severe
beating

the
woman
imagined
that
one
of
the
female
slaves
had
informed
him
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
her
paramour
during
his
absence
she
therefore
called
them
together
and
made
them
swear
and
they
all
swore
that
they
had
not
told
their
master
anything
of
the
matter
but
confessed
that
they
had
heard
the
parrot
relate
to
him
what
had
passed
having
thus
established
on
the
testimony
of
the
slaves
the
fact
of
the
parrots
having
informed
her
husband
of
her
intrigue
she
ordered
one
of
these
slaves
to
grind
with
a
hand-mill
under
the
cage
another
to
sprinkle
water
from
above
and
a
third
to
move
a
mirror
from
side
to
side
during
the
next
night
on
which
her
husband
was
absent
and
on
the
following
morning
when
the
man
returned
from
an
entertainment
at
which
he
had
been
present
and
inquired
again
of
the
parrot
what
had
passed
that
night
during
his
absence
the
bird
answered
o
my
master
i
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
on
account
of
the
excessive
darkness
and
thunder
and
lightning
and
rain
now
this
happened
during
summer
so
he
said
to
her
what
strange
words
are
these
it
is
now
summer
when
nothing
of
what
thou
hast
described
ever
happensâthe
parrot
however
swore
by
allah
the
great
that
what
she
had
said
was
true
and
that
it
had
so
happened
upon
which
the
man
not
understanding
the
case
nor
knowing
the
plot
became
violently
enraged
and
took
out
the
bird
from
the
cage
and
threw
her
down
upon
the
ground
with
such
violence
that
he
killed
her

but
after
some
days
one
of
his
female
slaves
informed
him
of
the
truth
yet
he
would
not
believe
it
until
he
saw
his
wifes
paramour
going
out
from
his
house
when
he
drew
his
sword23
and
slew
the
traitor
by
a
blow
on
the
back
of
his
neck
so
also
did
he
to
his
treacherous
wife
and
thus
both
of
them
went
laden
with
the
sin
which
they
had
committed
to
the
fire
and
the
merchant
discovered
that
the
parrot
had
informed
him
truly
of
what
she
had
seen
and
he
mourned
grievously
for
her
loss

when
the
wezeer
heard
these
words
of
king
yoonÃn
he
said
o
king
of
great
dignity
what
hath
this
crafty
sageâthis
man
from81
whom
nought
but
mischief
proceedethâdone
unto
me
that
i
should
be
his
enemy
and
speak
evil
of
him
and
plot
with
thee
to
destroy
him
i
have
informed
thee
respecting
him
in
compassion
for
thee
and
in
fear
of
his
despoiling
thee
of
thy
happiness
and
if
my
words
be
not
true
destroy
me
as
the
wezeer
of
es-sindibÃd
was
destroyedâthe
king
asked
how
was
that
and
the
wezeer
thus
answeredâ

the
story
of
the
envious
wezeer
and
the
prince
and
the
ghooleh

the
king
above
mentioned
had
a
son
who
was
ardently
fond
of
the
chase24
and
he
had
a
wezeer
whom
he
charged
to
be
always
with
this
son
wherever
he
went
one
day
the
son
went
forth
to
hunt
and
his
fathers
wezeer
was
with
him
and
as
they
rode
together
they
saw
a
great
wild
beast
upon
which
the
wezeer
exclaimed
to
the
prince
away
after
this
wild
beast
the
kings
son
pursued
it
until
he
was
out
of
the
sight
of
his
attendants
and
the
beast
also
escaped
from
before
his
eyes
in
the
desert
and
while
the
prince
wandered
in
perplexity
not
knowing
whither
to
direct
his
course
he
met
in
his
way
a
damsel
who
was
weeping
he
said
to
her
who
art
thouâand
she
answered
i
am
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
kings
of
india
i
was
in
the
desert
and
slumber
overtook
me
and
i
fell
from
my
horse
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
being
thus
separated
from
my
attendants
i
lost
my
way
the
prince
on
hearing
this
pitied
her
forlorn
state
and
placed
her
behind
him
on
his
horse
and
as
they
proceeded
they
passed
by
a
ruin25
and
the
damsel
said
to
him
o
my
master
i
would
alight
here
for
a
little
while
the
prince
therefore
lifted
her
from
his
horse
at
this
ruin
but
she
delayed
so
long
to
return
that
he
wondered
wherefore
she
had
loitered
so
and
entering
after
her
without
her
knowledge
perceived
that
she
was
a
ghooleh26
and
heard
her
say
my
children
i
have
brought
you
to-day
a
fat
young
manâon
which
they
exclaimed
bring
him
in
to
us
o
mother
that
we
may
fill
our
stomachs
with
his
flesh
when
the
prince
heard
their
words
he
felt
assured
of
destruction
the
muscles
of
his
sides
quivered
and
fear
overcame
him
and
he
retreated
the
ghooleh
then
came
forth
and
seeing
that
he
appeared
alarmed
and
fearful
and
that
he
was
trembling
said
to
him
wherefore
dost
thou
fear
he
answered
i
have
an
enemy
of
whom
i
am
in
fear
the
ghooleh
said
thou
assertest
thyself
to
be
the
son
of
the
king
he
replied
yesâthen
said
she
wherefore
dost
thou
not82
give
some
money
to
thine
enemy
and
so
conciliate
him
he
answered
he
will
not
be
appeased
with
money
nor
with
anything
but
life
and
therefore
do
i
fear
him
i
am
an
injured
man
she
then
said
to
him
if
thou
be
an
injured
man
as
thou
affirmest
beg
aid
of
god
against
thine
oppressor
and
he
will
avert
from
thee
his
mischievous
design
and
that
of
every
other
person
whom
thou
fearest
upon
this
therefore
the
prince
raised
his
head
towards
heaven
and
said
o
thou
who
answerest
the
distressed
when
he
prayeth
to
thee
and
dispellest
evil
assist
me
and
cause
mine
enemy
to
depart
from
me
for
thou
art
able
to
do
whatsoever
thou
wiltâand
the
ghooleh
no
sooner
heard
his
prayer
than
she
departed
from
him
the
prince
then
returned
to
his
father
and
informed
him
of
the
conduct
of
the
wezeer
upon
which
the
king
gave
orders
that
the
minister
should
be
put
to
death83

the
prince
meeting
the
ghooleh
continuation
of
the
story
of
king
yoonÃn
and
the
sage
doobÃn

and
thou
o
king
continued
the
wezeer
of
king
yoonÃn
if
thou
trust
in
this
sage
he
will
kill
thee
in
the
foulest
manner
if
thou
continue
to
bestow
favours
upon
him
and
to
make
him
thine
intimate
companion
he
will
plot
thy
destruction
dost
thou
not
see
that
he
hath
cured
thee
of
the
disease
by
external
means
by
a
thing
that
thou
heldest
in
thy
hand
therefore
thou
art
not
secure
against
his
killing
thee
by
a
thing
that
thou
shalt
hold
in
the
same
mannerâking
yoonÃn
answered
thou
hast
spoken
truth
the
case
is
as
thou
hast
said
o
faithful
wezeer
it
is
probable
that
this
sage
came
as
a
spy
to
accomplish
my
death
and
if
he
cured
me
by
a
thing
i
held
in
my
hand
he
may
destroy
me
by
a
thing
that
i
may
smell
what
then
o
wezeer
shall
be
done
respecting
him
the
wezeer
answered
send
to
him
immediately
and
desire
him
to
come
hither
and
when
he
is
come
strike
off
his
head
and
so
shalt
thou
avert
from
thee
his
evil
design
and
be
secure
from
him
betray
him
before
he
betray
theeâthe
king
said
thou
hast
spoken
right

immediately
therefore
he
sent
for
the
sage
who
came
full
of
joy
not
knowing
what
the
compassionate27
had
decreed
against
him
and
addressed
the
king
with
these
words
of
the
poetâ

if
i
fail
any
day
to
render
thee
due
thanks
tell
me
for
whom
i
have
composed
my
verse
and
prose
thou
hast
loaded
me
with
favours
unsolicited
bestowed
without
delay
on
thy
part
or
excuse
how
then
should
i
abstain
from
praising
thee
as
thou
deservest
and
lauding
thee
both
with
my
heart
and
voice
nay
i
will
thank
thee
for
thy
benefits
conferred
upon
me
they
are
light
upon
my
tongue
though
weighty
to
my
back
knowest
thou
said
the
king
wherefore
i
have
summoned
thee
the
sage
answered
none
knoweth
what
is
secret
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
then
said
the
king
i
have
summoned
thee
that
i
may
take
away
thy
life
the
sage
in
the
utmost
astonishment
at
this
announcement
said
o
king
wherefore
wouldst
thou
kill
me
and
what
offence
hath
been
committed
by
me
the
king
answered
it
hath
been
told
me
that
thou
art
a
spy
and
that
thou
hast
come
hither
to
kill
me
but
i
will
prevent
thee
by
killing
thee
firstâand
so
saying
he
called
out
to
the
executioner
strike
off
the
head
of
this
traitor
and
relieve
me
from
his
wickednessâspare
me
said
the
sage
and
so
may84
god
spare
thee
and
destroy
me
not
lest
god
destroy
theeâand
he
repeated
these
words
several
times
like
as
i
did
o
efreet
but
thou
wouldst
not
let
me
go
desiring
to
destroy
me

doobÃn
and
the
executioner
king
yoonÃn
then
said
to
the
sage
doobÃn
i
shall
not
be
secure
unless
i
kill
thee
for
thou
curedst
me
by
a
thing
that
i
held
in
my
hand
and
i
have
no
security
against
thy
killing
me
by
a
thing
that
i
may
smell
or
by
some
other
meansâo
king
said
the
sage
is
this
my
recompense
from
thee
dost
thou
return
evil
for
goodâthe
king
answered
thou
must
be
slain
without
delay
when
the
sage
therefore
was
convinced
that
the
king
intended
to
put
him
to
death
and
that
his
fate
was
inevitable
he
lamented
the
benefit
that
he
had
done
to
the
undeserving
the
executioner
then
advanced
and
bandaged
his
eyes
and
having
drawn
his
sword
said
give
permission
upon
this
the
sage
wept
and
said
again
spare
me
and
so
may
god
spare
thee
and
destroy
me
not
lest
god
destroy
thee
wouldst
thou
return
me
the
recompense
of
the
crocodileâwhat
said
the
king
is
the
story
of
the
crocodile
the
sage
answered
i
cannot
relate
it
while
in
this
condition28
but
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
to
spare
me
and
so
may
he
spare
thee
and
he
wept
bitterly
then
one
of
the
chief
officers
of
the
king
arose
and
said
o
king
give
up
to
me
the
blood
of
this
sage
for
we
have
not
seen
him
commit
any
offence
against
thee
nor
have
we
seen
him
do
aught
but
cure
thee
of
thy
disease
which
wearied
the
other
physicians
and
sages
the
king
answered
ye
know
not
the
reason
wherefore
i
would
kill
the
sage
it
is
this
that
if
i
suffered
him
to
live
i
should
myself
inevitably
perish
for
he
who
cured
me
of
the
disease
under
which
i
suffered
by
a
thing
that
i
held
in
my85
hand
may
kill
me
by
a
thing
that
i
may
smell
and
i
fear
that
he
would
do
so
and
would
receive
an
appointment
on
account
of
it
seeing
that
it
is
probable
he
is
a
spy
who
hath
come
hither
to
kill
me
i
must
therefore
kill
him
and
then
shall
i
feel
myself
safeâthe
sage
then
said
again
spare
me
and
so
may
god
spare
thee
and
destroy
me
not
lest
god
destroy
thee

but
he
now
felt
certain
o
efreet
that
the
king
would
put
him
to
death
and
that
there
was
no
escape
for
him
so
he
said
o
king
if
my
death
is
indispensable
grant
me
some
respite
that
i
may
return
to
my
house
and
acquit
myself
of
my
duties
and
give
directions
to
my
family
and
neighbours
to
bury
me
and
dispose
of
my
medical
books
and
among
my
books
is
one
of
most
especial
value
which
i
offer
as
a
present
to
thee
that
thou
mayest
treasure
it
in
thy
libraryâand
what
said
the
king
is
this
book
he
answered
it
contains
things
not
to
be
enumerated
and
the
smallest
of
the
secret
virtues
that
it
possesses
is
this
that
when
thou
hast
cut
off
my
head
if
thou
open
this
book
and
count
three
leaves
and
then
read
three
lines
on
the
page
to
the
left
the
head
will
speak
to
thee
and
answer
whatever
thou
shalt
ask
at
this
the
king
was
excessively
astonished
and
shook
with
delight
and
said
to
him
o
sage
when
i
have
cut
off
thy
head
will
it
speak
he
answered
yes
o
king
and
this
is
a
wonderful
thing

the
king
then
sent
him
in
the
custody
of
guards
and
the
sage
descended
to
his
house
and
settled
all
his
affairs
on
that
day
and
on
the
following
day
he
went
up
to
the
court
and
the
emeers
and
wezeers
and
chamberlains
and
deputies
and
all
the
great
officers
of
the
state
went
thither
also
and
the
court
resembled
a
flower-garden29
and
when
the
sage
had
entered
he
presented
himself
before
the
king
bearing
an
old
book
and
a
small
pot
containing
a
powder
and
he
sat
down
and
said
bring
me
a
tray
so
they
brought
him
one
and
he
poured
out
the
powder
into
it
and
spread
it
he
then
said
o
king
take
this
book
and
do
nothing
with
it
until
thou
hast
cut
off
my
head
and
when
thou
hast
done
so
place
it
upon
this
tray
and
order
some
one
to
press
it
down
upon
the
powder
and
when
this
is
done
the
blood
will
be
stanched
then
open
the
book
as
soon
as
the
sage
had
said
this
the
king
gave
orders
to
strike
off
his
head
and
it
was
done
the
king
then
opened
the
book
and
found
that
its
leaves
were
stuck
together
so
he
put
his
finger
to
his
mouth
and
moistened
it
with
his
spittle
and
opened
the
first
leaf
and
the
second
and
the
third
but
the
leaves
were
not
opened
without
difficulty
he86
opened
six
leaves
and
looked
at
them
but
found
upon
them
no
writing
so
he
said
o
sage
there
is
nothing
written
in
it
the
head
of
the
sage
answered
turn
over
more
leaves
the
king
did
so
and
in
a
little
while
the
poison
penetrated
into
his
system
for
the
book
was
poisoned
and
the
king
fell
back
and
cried
out
the
poison
hath
penetrated
into
meâand
upon
this
the
head
of
the
sage
doobÃn
repeated
these
versesâ

they
made
use
of
their
power
and
used
it
tyrannically
and
soon
it
became
as
though
it
never
had
existed
had
they
acted
equitably
they
had
experienced
equity
but
they
oppressed
wherefore
fortune
oppressed
them
with
calamities
and
trials
then
did
the
case
itself
announce
to
them
this
is
the
reward
of
your
conduct
and
fortune
is
blameless
and
when
the
head
of
the
sage
doobÃn
had
uttered
these
words
the
king
immediately
fell
down
dead30

that
if
king
yoonÃn
had
spared
the
sage
doobÃn
god
had
spared
him
but
he
refused
and
desired
his
destruction
therefore
god
destroyed
him
and
thou
o
efreet
if
thou
hadst
spared
me
god
had
spared
thee
and
i
had
spared
thee
but
thou
desiredst
my
death
therefore
will
i
put
thee
to
death
imprisoned
in
this
bottle
and
will
throw
thee
here
into
the
sea
the
mÃrid
upon
this
cried
out
and
said
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
o
fisherman
that
thou
do
it
not
spare
me
in
generosity
and
be
not
angry
with
me
for
what
i
did
but
if
i
have
done
evil
do
thou87
good
according
to
the
proverbâo
thou
benefactor
of
him
who
hath
done
evil
the
action
that
he
hath
done
is
sufficient
for
himâdo
not
therefore
as
umÃmeh
did
to
Ãtikehâand
what
said
the
fisherman
was
their
case
the
efreet
answered
this
is
not
a
time
for
telling
stories
when
i
am
in
this
prison
but
when
thou
liberatest
me
i
will
relate
to
thee
their
case31
the
fisherman
said
thou
must
be
thrown
into
the
sea
and
there
shall
be
no
way
of
escape
for
thee
from
it
for
i
endeavoured
to
propitiate
thee
and
humbled
myself
before
thee
yet
thou
wouldest
nothing
but
my
destruction
though
i
had
committed
no
offence
to
deserve
it
and
had
done
no
evil
to
thee
whatever
but
only
good
delivering
thee
from
thy
confinement
and
when
thou
didst
thus
unto
me
i
perceived
that
thou
wast
radically
corrupt
and
i
would
have
thee
know
that
my
motive
for
throwing
thee
into
this
sea
is
that
i
may
acquaint
with
thy
story
every
one
that
shall
take
thee
out
and
caution
him
against
thee
that
he
may
cast
thee
in
again
thus
shalt
thou
remain
in
this
sea
to
the
end
of
time
and
experience
varieties
of
tormentâthe
efreet
then
said
liberate
me
for
this
is
an
opportunity
for
thee
to
display
humanity
and
i
vow
to
thee
that
i
will
never
do
thee
harm
but
on
the
contrary
will
do
thee
a
service
that
shall
enrich
thee
for
ever

upon
this
the
fisherman
accepted
his
covenant
that
he
would
not
hurt
him
but
that
he
would
do
him
good
and
when
he
had
bound
him
by
oaths
and
vows
and
made
him
swear
by
the
most
great
name
of
god
he
opened
to
him
and
the
smoke
ascended
until
it
had
all
come
forth
and
then
collected
together
and
became
as
before
an
efreet
of
hideous
form
the
efreet
then
kicked
the
bottle
into
the
sea
when
the
fisherman
saw
him
do
this
he
made
sure
of
destruction
and
said
this
is
no
sign
of
goodâbut
afterwards
he
fortified
his
heart
and
said
o
efreet
god
whose
name
be
exalted
hath
said
perform
the
covenant
for
the
covenant
shall
be
inquired
into32âand
thou
has
covenanted
with
me
and
sworn
that
thou
wilt
not
act
treacherously
towards
me
therefore
if
thou
so
act
god
will
recompense
thee
for
he
is
jealous
he
respiteth
but
suffereth
not
to
escape
and
remember
that
i
said
to
thee
as
said
the
sage
doobÃn
to
king
yoonÃn
spare
me
and
so
may
god
spare
thee

the
efreet
laughed
and
walking
on
before
him
said
o
fisherman
follow
me
the
fisherman
did
so
not
believing
in
his
escape
until
they
had
quitted
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
and
ascended
a
mountain
and
descended
into
a
wide
desert
tract
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
lake
of
water
here
the
efreet
stopped
and
ordered88
the
fisherman
to
cast
his
net
and
take
some
fish
and
the
fisherman
looking
into
the
lake
saw
in
it
fish
of
different
colours
white
and
red
and
blue
and
yellow
at
which
he
was
astonished
and
he
cast
his
net
and
drew
it
in
and
found
in
it
four
fish
each
fish
of
a
different
colour
from
the
others
at
the
sight
of
which
he
rejoiced
the
efreet
then
said
to
him
take
them
to
the
suláÃn33
and
present
them
to
him
and
he
will
give
thee
what
will
enrich
thee
and
for
the
sake
of
god
accept
my
excuse
for
at
present
i
know
no
other
way
of
rewarding
thee
having
been
in
the
sea
a
thousand
and
eight
hundred
years
and
not
seen
the
surface
of
the
earth
until
now
but
take
not
fish
from
the
lake
more
than
once
each
day
and
now
i
commend
thee
to
the
care
of
godâhaving
thus
said
he
struck
the
earth
with
his
feet
and
it
clove
asunder
and
swallowed
him

the
fish
of
four
colours
the
fisherman
then
went
back
to
the
city
wondering
at
all
that
had
befallen
him
with
the
efreet
and
carried
the
fish
to
his
house
and
he
took
an
earthen
bowl
and
having
filled
it
with
water
put
the
fish
into
it
and
they
struggled
in
the
water
and
when
he
had
done
this
he
placed
the
bowl
upon
his
head
and
repaired
to
the
kings
palace
as
the
efreet
had
commanded
him
and
going
up
unto
the
king
presented
to
him
the
fish
and
the
king
was
excessively
astonished
at
them
for
he
had
never
seen
any
like
them
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
he
said
give
these
fish
to
the
slave
cook-maid
this
maid
had
been
sent
as
a
present
to
him
by
the
king
of
the
greeks
three
days
before
and
he
had
not
yet
tried
her
skill
the
wezeer
therefore
ordered
her
to
fry
the
fish
and
said
to
her
o
maid
the
king
saith
unto
thee
i
have
not
reserved
my
tear
but
for
the
time
of
my
difficultyâto-day
then
gratify
us
by
a
specimen
of
thy
excellent
cookery
for
a
person
hath
brought
these
fish
as
a
present
to
the
suláÃn
after
having
thus
charged
her
the
wezeer
returned
and
the
king
ordered
him
to
give
the
fisherman
four
hundred
pieces
of89
gold
so
the
wezeer
gave
them
to
him
and
he
took
them
in
his
lap
and
returned
to
his
home
and
his
wife
joyful
and
happy
and
bought
what
was
needful
for
his
family

the
fisherman
shewing
the
fish
to
the
suláÃn
such
were
the
events
that
befell
the
fisherman
now
we
must
relate
what
happened
to
the
maidâshe
took
the
fish
and
cleaned
them
and
arranged
them
in
the
frying-pan
and
left
them
until
one
side
was
cooked
when
she
turned
them
upon
the
other
side
and
lo
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
clove
asunder
and
there
came
forth
from
it
a
damsel
of
tall
stature
smooth-cheeked
of
perfect
form
with
eyes
adorned
with
koál34
beautiful
in
countenance
and
with
heavy
swelling
hips
wearing
a
koofeeyeh35
interwoven
with
blue
silk
with
rings
in
her
ears
and
bracelets
on
her
wrists
and
rings
set
with
precious
jewels
on
her
fingers
and
in
her
hand
was
a
rod
of
indian
cane
and
she
dipped
the
end
of
the
rod
in
the
frying-pan
and
said
o
fish
are
ye
remaining
faithful
to
your
covenant
at
the
sight
of
this
the
cook-maid
fainted
the
damsel
then
repeated
the
same
words
a
second
and
a
third
time
after
which
the
fish
raised
their
heads
from
the
frying-pan
and
answered
yes
yes
they
then
repeated
the
following
verseâ

if
thou
return
we
return
and
if
thou
come
we
come
and
if
thou
forsake
we
verily
do
the
same
and
upon
this
the
damsel
overturned
the
frying-pan
and
departed
by
the
way
she
had
entered
and
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
closed
up
again
the
cook-maid
then
arose
and
beheld
the
four
fish
burnt
like
charcoal
and
she
exclaimed
in
his
first
encounter
his
staff
brokeâand
as
she
sat
reproaching
herself
she
beheld
the
wezeer
standing
at
her
head
and
he
said
to
her
bring
the
fish
to
the
suláÃnâand
she
wept
and
informed
him
of
what
had
happened3690

the
cook-maid
dressing
the
fish
the
wezeer
was
astonished
at
her
words
and
exclaimed
this
is
indeed
a
wonderful
eventâand
he
sent
for
the
fisherman
and
when
he
was
brought
he
said
to
him
o
fisherman
thou
must
bring
to
us
four
fish
like
those
which
thou
broughtest
before
the
fisherman
accordingly
went
forth
to
the
lake
and
threw
his
net
and
when
he
had
drawn
it
in
he
found
in
it
four
fish
as
before
and
he
took
them
to
the
wezeer
who
went
with
them
to
the
maid
and
said
to
her
rise
and
fry
them
in
my
presence
that
i
may
witness
this
occurrence
the
maid
therefore
prepared
the
fish
and
put
them
in
the
frying-pan
and
they
had
remained
but
a
little
while
when
the
wall
clove
asunder
and
the
damsel
appeared
clad
as
before
and
holding
the
rod
and
she
dipped
the
end
of
the
rod
in
the
frying-pan
and
said
o
fish
o
fish
are
ye
remaining
faithful
to
your
old
covenant
upon
which
they
raised
their
heads
and
answered
as
before
and
the
damsel
overturned
the
frying-pan
with
the
rod
and
returned
by
the
way
she
had
entered
and
the
wall
closed
up
again

the
wezeer
then
said
this
is
an
event
which
cannot
be
concealed91
from
the
kingâso
he
went
to
him
and
informed
him
of
what
had
happened
in
his
presence
and
the
king
said
i
must
see
this
with
my
own
eyes
he
sent
therefore
to
the
fisherman
and
commanded
him
to
bring
four
fish
like
the
former
granting
him
a
delay
of
three
days
and
the
fisherman
repaired
to
the
lake
and
brought
the
fish
thence
to
the
king
who
ordered
again
that
four
hundred
pieces
of
gold
should
be
given
to
him
and
then
turning
to
the
wezeer
said
to
him
cook
the
fish
thyself
here
before
me
the
wezeer
answered
i
hear
and
obey
he
brought
the
frying-pan
and
after
he
had
cleaned
the
fish
threw
them
into
it
and
as
soon
as
he
had
turned
them
the
wall
clove
asunder
and
there
came
forth
from
it
a
negro
in
size
like
a
bull
or
like
one
of
the
tribe
of
Ãd37
having
in
his
hand
a
branch
of
a
green
tree
and
he
said
with
a
clear
but
terrifying
voice
o
fish
o
fish
are
ye
remaining
faithful
to
your
old
covenant
upon
which
they
raised
their
heads
and
answered
as
before
yes
yes

if
thou
return
we
return
and
if
thou
come
we
come
and
if
thou
forsake
we
verily
do
the
same
the
black
then
approached
the
frying-pan
and
overturned
it
with
the
branch
and
the
fish
became
like
charcoal
and
he
went
away
as
he
had
come

when
he
had
thus
disappeared
from
before
their
eyes
the
king
said
this
is
an
event
respecting
which
it
is
impossible
to
keep
silence
and
there
must
undoubtedly
be
some
strange
circumstance
connected
with
these
fish
he
then
ordered
that
the
fisherman
should
be
brought
before
him
and
when
he
had
come
he
said
to
him
whence
came
these
fish
the
fisherman
answered
from
a
lake
between
four
mountains
behind
this
mountain
which
is
without
thy
city
the
king
said
to
him
how
many
days
journey38
distant
he
answered
o
our
lord
the
suláÃn
a
journey
of
half-an-hour
and
the
suláÃn
was
astonished
and
ordered
his
troops
to
go
out
immediately
with
him
and
the
fisherman
who
began
to
curse
the
efreet
they
proceeded
until
they
had
ascended
the
mountain
and
descended
into
a
wide
desert
tract
which
they
had
never
before
seen
in
their
whole
lives
and
the
suláÃn
and
all
the
troops
wondered
at
the
sight
of
this
desert
which
was
between
four
mountains
and
at
the
fish
which
were
of
four
colours
red
and
white
and
yellow
and
blue
the
king
paused
in
astonishment
and
said
to
the
troops
and
to
the
other
attendants
who
were
with
him
hath
any
one
of
you
before
seen
this
lake
in
this
place
they
all
answered
no
then
said
the
king
by
allah
i
will
not
enter
my
city
nor
will
i
sit
upon
my
throne
until
i
know
the
true
history
of92
this
lake
and
of
its
fish
and
upon
this
he
ordered
his
people
to
encamp
around
these
mountains
and
they
did
so
he
then
called
for
the
wezeer
who
was
a
well-informed
sensible
prudent
and
learned
man
and
when
he
had
presented
himself
before
him
he
said
to
him
i
desire
to
do
a
thing
with
which
i
will
acquaint
thee
and
it
is
thisâi
have
resolved
to
depart
alone
this
night
to
seek
for
information
respecting
this
lake
and
its
fish
therefore
sit
thou
at
the
door
of
my
pavilion
and
say
to
the
emeers
and
wezeers
and
chamberlains
the
suláÃn
is
sick
and
hath
commanded
me
not
to
allow
any
person
to
go
in
unto
himâand
acquaint
no
one
with
my
intention

the
black
palace
the
wezeer
was
unable
to
oppose
his
design
so
the
king
disguised
himself
and
slung
on
his
sword
and
withdrew
himself
from
the
midst
of
his
troops
he
journeyed
the
whole
of
the
night
until
the
morning
and
proceeded
until
the
heat
became
oppressive
to
him
he
then
paused
to
rest
after
which
he
again
proceeded
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
second
night
until
the
morning
when
there
appeared
before
him
in
the
distance
something
black
at
the
sight
of
which
he
rejoiced
and
said
perhaps
i
shall
there
find
some
person
who
will
inform
me
of
the
history
of
the
lake
and
its
fish
and
when
he
approached
this
black
object
he
found
it
to
be
a
palace
built
of
black
stones
and
overlaid
with
iron
and
one
of
the
leaves
of
its
doors
was
open
and
the
other
shut
the
king
was
glad
and
he
stood
at
the
door
and
knocked
gently
but
heard
no
answer
he
knocked
a
second
and
a
third
time
but
again
heard
no
answer
then
he
knocked
a
fourth
time
and
with
violence
but
no
one
answered
so
he
said
it
is
doubtless
emptyâand
he
took
courage
and
entered
from
the
door
into
the
passage
and
cried
out
saying
o
inhabitants
of
the
palace
i
am
a
stranger
and
a
traveller
have
ye
any
provision
and
he
repeated
these
words
a
second
and
a
third
time
but
heard
no
answer93
and
upon
this
he
fortified
his
heart
and
emboldened
himself
and
proceeded
from
the
passage
into
the
midst
of
the
palace
but
he
found
no
one
there
and
only
saw
that
it
was
furnished
and
that
there
was
in
the
centre
of
it
a
fountain
with
four
lions
of
red
gold
which
poured
forth
the
water
from
their
mouths
like
pearls
and
jewels
around
this
were
birds
and
over
the
top
of
the
palace
was
extended
a
net
which
prevented
their
flying
out
at
the
sight
of
these
objects
he
was
astonished
and
he
was
grieved
that
he
saw
no
person
there
whom
he
could
ask
for
information
respecting
the
lake
and
the
fish
and
the
mountains
and
the
palace
he
then
sat
down
between
the
doors39
reflecting
upon
these
things
and
as
he
thus
sat
he
heard
a
voice
of
lamentation
from
a
sorrowful
heart
chanting
these
versesâ

o
fortune
thou
pitiest
me
not
nor
releasest
me
see
my
heart
is
straitened
between
affliction
and
peril
will
not
you
o
my
wife
have
compassion
on
the
mighty
whom
love
hath
abased
and
the
wealthy
who
is
reduced
to
indigence
we
were
jealous
even
of
the
zephyr
which
passed
over
you
but
when
the
divine
decree
is
issued
the
eye
becometh
blind
what
resource
hath
the
archer
when
in
the
hour
of
conflict
he
desireth
to
discharge
the
arrow
but
findeth
his
bow-string
broken
and
when
troubles
are
multiplied
upon
the
noble-minded
where
shall
he
find
refuge
from
fate
and
from
destiny40
when
the
suláÃn
heard
this
lamentation
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
and
seeking
the
direction
whence
it
proceeded
found
a
curtain
suspended
before
the
door
of
a
chamber
and
he
raised
it
and
beheld
behind
it
a
young
man
sitting
on
a
couch
raised
to
the
height
of
a
cubit
from
the
floor
he
was
a
handsome
youth
well-shaped
and
of
eloquent
speech
with
shining
forehead
and
rosy
cheek
marked
with
a
mole
resembling
ambergris
the
king
was
rejoiced
at
seeing
him
and
saluted
him
and
the
young
man
who
remained
sitting
and
was
clad
with
a
vest
of
silk
embroidered
with
gold
but
who
exhibited
traces
of
grief
returned
his
salutation
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
excuse
my
not
risingâo
youth
said
the
king
inform
me
respecting
the
lake
and
its
fish
of
various
colours
and
respecting
this
palace
and
the
reason
of
thy
being
alone
in
it
and
of
thy
lamentation
when
the
young
man
heard
these
words
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
and
he
wept
bitterly41
and
the
king
was
astonished
and
said
to
him
what
causeth
thee
to
weep
o
youth
he
answered
how
can
i
refrain
from
weeping
when
this
is
my
stateâand
so
saying
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
lifted
up
the
skirts
of
his
clothing
and
lo
half
of
him
from
his
waist
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
was
stone
and
from94
his
waist
to
the
hair
of
his
head
he
was
like
other
men
he
then
said
know
o
king
that
the
story
of
the
fish
is
extraordinary
if
it
were
engraved
upon
the
intellect
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
who
would
be
admonishedâand
he
related
as
followsâ

the
sultÃn
discovering
the
young
king
of
the
black
islands
the
story
of
the
young
king
of
the
black
islands

my
father
was
king
of
the
city
which
was
here
situate
his
name
was
maámood
and
he
was
lord
of
the
black
islands
and
of
the
four
mountains
after
a
reign
of
seventy
years
he
died
and
i
succeeded
to
his
throne
whereupon
i
took
as
my
wife
the
daughter
of
my
uncle
and
she
loved
me
excessively
so
that
when
i
absented
myself
from
her
she
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
she
saw
me
again
she
remained
under
my
protection
five
years
after
this
she
went
one
day
to
the
bath
and
i
had
commanded
the
cook
to
prepare
the
supper
and
entered
this
palace
and
slept
in
my
usual
place42
i
had
ordered
two
maids
to
fan
me43
and
one
of
them
sat
at
my
head
and
the
other
at
my
feet
but
i
was
restless
because
my
wife
was
not
with
me
and
i
could
not
sleep
my
eyes
were
closed
but
my
spirit95
was
awake
and
i
heard
the
maid
at
my
head
say
to
her
at
my
feet
o
mesoodeh44
verily
our
lord
is
unfortunate
in
his
youth
and
what
a
pity
is
it
that
it
should
be
passed
with
our
depraved
wicked
mistressâperdition
to
unfaithful
wives
replied
the
other
but
added
she
such
a
person
as
our
lord
so
endowed
by
nature
is
not
suited
to
this
profligate
woman
who
passes
every
night
absent
from
his
bedâverily
rejoined
she
at
my
head
our
lord
is
careless
in
not
making
any
inquiry
respecting
herâwo
to
thee
said
the
other
hath
our
lord
any
knowledge
of
her
conduct
or
doth
she
leave
him
to
his
choice
nay
on
the
contrary
she
contriveth
to
defraud
him
by
means
of
the
cup
of
wine45
which
he
drinketh
every
night
before
he
sleepeth
putting
benj46
into
it
in
consequence
of
which
he
sleepeth
so
soundly
that
he
knoweth
not
what
happeneth
nor
whither
she
goeth
nor
what
she
doeth
for
after
she
hath
given
him
the
wine
to
drink
she
dresseth
herself
and
goeth
out
from
him
and
is
absent
until
daybreak
when
she
returneth
to
him
and
burneth
a
perfume
under
his
nose
upon
which
he
awaketh
from
his
sleep

the
young
king
on
his
bed
attended
by
two
maids
when
i
heard
this
conversation
of
the
maids
the
light
became
darkness
before
my
face
and
i
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
approach
of
night
when
my
cousin
returned
from
the
bath
the
table
was
prepared
and
we
ate
and
sat
a
while
drinking
our
wine
as
usual
i
then
called
for
the
wine
which
i
was
accustomed
to
drink
before
i
lay
down
to
sleep
and
she
handed
to
me
the
cup
but
i
turned
away
and
pretending
to
drink
it
as
i
was
wont
to
do
poured
it
into
my
bosom
and
immediately
lay
down
upon
which
she
said
sleep
on
i
wish96
that
thou
wouldst
never
wake
again
by
allah
i
abhor
thee
and
abhor
thy
person
and
my
soul
is
weary
of
thy
companyâshe
then
arose
and
attired
herself
in
the
most
magnificent
of
her
apparel
and
having
perfumed
herself
and
slung
on
a
sword
opened
the
door
of
the
palace
and
went
out
i
got
up
immediately
and
followed
her
until
she
had
quitted
the
palace
and
passed
through
the
streets
of
the
city
and
arrived
at
the
city-gates
when
she
pronounced
some
words
that
i
understood
not
whereupon
the
locks
fell
off
and
the
gates
opened
and
she
went
out
i
still
following
her
without
her
knowledge
thence
she
proceeded
to
a
space
among
the
mounds47
and
arrived
at
a
strong
edifice
in
which
was
a
áubbeh48
constructed
of
mud
with
a
door
which
she
entered
i
then
climbed
upon
the
roof
of
the
áubbeh
and
looking
down
upon
her
through
an
aperture
saw
that
she
was
visiting
a
black
slave
whose
large
lips
one
of
which
overlapped
the
other
gathered
up
the
sand
from
the
pebbly
floor
while
he
lay
in
a
filthy
and
wet
condition
upon
a
few
stalks
of
sugar-cane

she
kissed
the
ground
before
this
slave
and
he
raised
his
head
towards
her
and
said
wo
to
thee
wherefore
hast
thou
remained
away
until
this
hour
the
other
blacks
have
been
here
drinking
wine
and
each
of
them
has
gone
away
with
his
mistress
and
i
refused
to
drink
on
thy
accountâshe
answered
o
my
master
and
beloved
of
my
heart
knowest
thou
not
that
i
am
married
to
my
cousin
and
that
i
abhor
every
man
who
resembles
him
and
hate
myself
while
i
am
in
his
company
if
i
did
not
fear
to
displease
thee
i
would
reduce
the
city
to
ruins
so
that
the
owl
and
the
raven
should
cry
in
it
and
would
transport
its
stones
beyond
mount
áÃf49âthou
liest
thou
infamous
woman
replied
the
slave
and
i
swear
by
the
generosity
of
the
blacks
and
if
i
speak
not
truth
may
our
valour
be
as
the
valour
of
the
whites
that
if
thou
loiter
as
thou
hast
now
done
till
this
hour
i
will
no
longer
give
thee
my
company
nor
approach
thy
person
thou
faithless
one
dost
thou
inconvenience
me
for
the
sake
of
thine
own
pleasure
thou
filthy
wretch
and
vilest
of
the
whitesâwhen
i
heard
continued
the
king
their
words
and
witnessed
what
passed
between
them
the
world
became
dark
before
my
face
and
i
knew
not
where
i
wasâmy
cousin
still
stood
weeping
and
abasing
herself
before
him
and
said
o
my
beloved
and
treasure
of
my
heart
there
remaineth
to
me
none
but
thee
for
whom
i
care
and
if
thou
cast
me
off
alas
for
me
o
my
beloved
o
light
of
mine
eyeâthus
she
continued
to
weep
and
to
humble
herself
before
him
until
he
became
pacified
towards
her
upon
which
she
rejoiced
and
arose
and
having
dis97robed
herself
said
to
him
o
my
master
hast
thou
here
anything
that
thy
maid
may
eat
he
answered
uncover
the
dough-pan
it
contains
some
cooked
rats
bones50
eat
of
them
and
pick
them
and
take
this
earthen
pot
thou
wilt
find
in
it
some
booáºah51
to
drink
so
she
arose
and
ate
and
drank
and
washed
her
hands
after
which
she
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
slave
upon
the
stalks
of
sugar-cane
and
covered
herself
with
his
tattered
clothes
and
rags

the
black
slave
wounded
by
the
young
king
when
i
saw
her
do
this
i
became
unconscious
of
my
existence
and
descending
from
the
roof
of
the
áubbeh
entered
and
took
the
sword
from
the
side
of
my
cousin
with
the
intention
of
killing
them
both
i
struck
the
slave
upon
his
neck
and
thought
that
he
was
killed
but
the
blow
which
i
gave
with
the
view
of
severing
his
head
only
cut
the
gullet
and
skin
and
flesh
and
when
i
thought
that
i
had
killed
him
he
uttered
a
loud
snore
upon
which
my
cousin
started
up
and
as
soon
as
i
had
gone
took
the
sword
and
returned
it
to
its98
scabbard
and
came
back
to
the
city
and
to
the
palace
and
lay
down
again
in
my
bed
in
which
she
remained
until
the
morning

on
the
following
day
i
observed
that
my
cousin
had
cut
off
her
hair
and
put
on
the
apparel
of
mourning52
and
she
said
to
me
o
my
cousin
blame
me
not
for
what
i
do
for
i
have
received
news
that
my
mother
is
dead
and
that
my
father
hath
been
slain
in
a
holy
war
and
that
one
of
my
two
brothers
hath
died
of
a
poisonous
sting
and
the
other
by
the
fall
of
a
house
it
is
natural
therefore
that
i
should
weep
and
mourn
on
hearing
these
words
i
abstained
from
upbraiding
her
and
said
do
what
seemeth
fit
to
thee
for
i
will
not
oppose
thee
accordingly
she
continued
mourning
and
weeping
and
wailing
a
whole
year
after
which
she
said
to
me
i
have
a
desire
to
build
for
myself
in
thy
palace
a
tomb
with
a
áubbeh
that
i
may
repair
thither
alone
to
mourn
and
i
will
call
it
the
house
of
lamentations53
i
replied
do
what
thou
seest
fit
so
she
built
for
herself
a
house
for
mourning
with
a
áubbeh
in
the
middle
of
it
like
the
tomb
of
a
saint54
after
which
she
removed
thither
the
slave
and
there
she
lodged
him
he
was
in
a
state
of
excessive
weakness
and
unable
to
render
her
any
service
though
he
drank
wine
and
from
the
day
on
which
i
had
wounded
him
he
had
never
spoken
yet
he
remained
alive
because
the
appointed
term
of
his
life
had
not
expired
my
cousin
every
day
visited
him
in
this
tomb
early
and
late
to
weep
and
mourn
over
him
and
took
to
him
wine
to
drink
and
boiled
meats
and
thus
she
continued
to
do
morning
and
evening
until
the
expiration
of
the
second
year
while
i
patiently
suffered
her
till
one
day
i
entered
her
apartment
unawares
and
found
her
weeping
and
slapping
her
face
and
repeating
these
versesâ

i
have
lost
my
existence
among
mankind
since
your
absence
for
my
heart
loveth
none
but
you
take
my
body
then
in
mercy
to
the
place
where
you
are
laid
and
there
bury
me
by
your
side
and
if
at
my
grave
you
utter
my
name
the
moaning
of
my
bones
shall
answer
to
your
call
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
the
recitation
of
these
verses
i
said
to
her
holding
my
drawn
sword
in
my
hand
this
is
the
language
of
those
faithless
women
who
renounce
the
ties
of
affinity
and
regard
not
lawful
fellowshipâand
i
was
about
to
strike
her
with
the
sword
and
had
lifted
up
my
arm
to
do
so
when
she
roseâfor
she
knew
that
it
was
i
who
had
wounded
the
slaveâand
standing
before
me
pronounced
some
words
which
i
understood
not
and
said
may
god
by
means
of
my
enchantment
make
thee
to
be
half
of
stone
and
half
of99
the
substance
of
manâwhereupon
i
became
as
thou
seest
unable
to
move
neither
dead
nor
alive
and
when
i
had
been
reduced
to
this
state
she
enchanted
the
city
and
its
markets
and
fields
the
inhabitants
of
our
city
were
of
four
classes
muslims
and
christians
and
jews
and
magians
and
she
transformed
them
into
fish
the
white
are
the
muslims
the
red
the
magians
the
blue
the
christians
and
the
yellow
the
jews55
she
transformed
also
the
four
islands
into
four
mountains
and
placed
them
around
the
lake
and
from
that
time
she
has
continued
every
day
to
torture
me
inflicting
upon
me
a
hundred
lashes
with
a
leathern
whip
until
the
blood
flows
from
my
wounds
after
which
she
puts
on
my
upper
half
a
vest
of
hair-cloth
beneath
these
garmentsâhaving
said
thus
the
young
man
wept
and
ejaculating
the
following
versesâ

give
me
patience
o
allah
to
bear
what
thou
decreest
i
will
be
patient
if
so
i
may
obtain
thine
approval
i
am
straitened
indeed
by
the
calamity
that
hath
befallen
me
but
the
family
of
the
favoured
prophet
shall
intercede
for
me56
upon
this
the
king
looking
towards
the
young
man
said
to
him
o
youth
thou
hast
increased
my
anxiety
and
where
he
added
is
this
womanâthe
young
man
answered
she
is
in
the
tomb
where
the
slave
is
lying
in
the
áubbeh
and
every
day
before
she
visits
him
she
strips
me
of
my
clothing
and
inflicts
upon
me
a
hundred
lashes
with
the
whip
while
i
weep
and
cry
out
unable
to
move
so
as
to
repulse
her
after
thus
torturing
me
she
repairs
early
to
the
slave
with
the
wine
and
boiled
meatâby
allah
o
youth
said
the
king
i
will
do
thee
an
act
of
kindness
for
which
i
shall
be
remembered
and
a
favour
which
historians
shall
record
in
a
biography
after
me

the
kubbeh
or
tomb
he
then
sat
and
conversed
with
him
until
the
approach
of
night
upon
which
he
arose
and
waited
till
the
first
dawn
of
day
when
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
slung
on
his
sword
and
went
to
the
place
where
the
slave
lay
after
remarking
the
candles
and
lamps
and
perfumes
and
ointments
he
approached
the
slave
and
with
a
blow
of
his
sword
slew
him
he
then
carried
him
on
his
back
and
threw
him
into
a
well
which
he
found
in
the
palace
and
returning
to
the
áubbeh
clad
himself
with
the
slaves
clothes
and
lay
down
with
the
drawn
sword
by
his
side
soon
after
the
vile
enchantress
went
to
her
cousin
and
having
pulled
off
his
clothes
took
the
whip
and
beat
him
while
he
cried
ah
it
is
enough
for
me
to
be
in
this
state
have
pity
on
me
thenâdidst
thou
shew
pity
to
me
she
exclaimed
and
didst
thou100
spare
my
loverâshe
then
put
on
him
the
hair-cloth
vest
and
his
outer
garments
and
repaired
to
the
slave
with
a
cup
of
wine
and
a
bowl
of
boiled
meat
entering
the
tomb
she
wept
and
wailed
exclaiming
o
my
master
answer
me
o
my
master
speak
to
meâand
poured
forth
her
lamentation
in
the
words
of
this
verseâ

how
long
shall
this
aversion
and
harshness
continue
sufficient
is
the
evil
which
my
passion
hath
brought
upon
me57
then
weeping
as
before
she
exclaimed
again
o
my
master
answer
me
and
speak
to
me
upon
this
the
king
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
adapting
his
tongue
to
the
pronunciation
of
the
blacks
ejaculated
ah
ah
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
on
hearing
these
words
she
screamed
with
joy
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
she
recovered
she
exclaimed
possibly
my
master
is
restored
to
health
the
king
again
lowering
his
voice
as
if
from
weakness
replied
thou
profligate
wretch
thou
deservest
not
that
i
should
address
theeâwherefore
said
she
he
answered
because
all
the
day
long
thou
tormentest
thy
husband
while
he
calleth
out
and
imploreth
the
aid
of
god
so
that
thou
hast
prevented
my
sleeping
from
the
commencement
of
darkness
until
morning
thy
husband
hath
not
ceased
to
humble
himself
and
to
imprecate
vengeance
upon
thee
till
he
hath
distracted
me
and
had
it
not
been
for
this
i
had
recovered
my
strength
this
it
is
which
hath
prevented
my
answering
theeâthen
with
thy
permission
she
replied
i
will
liberate
him
from
his
present
sufferingsâliberate
him
said
the
king
and
give
us
ease

she
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
immediately
arose
and
went
out
from
the
áubbeh
to
the
palace
and
taking
a
cup
filled
it
with
water
and
pronounced
certain
words
over
it
upon
which
it
began
to
boil
like
a
cauldron
she
then
sprinkled
some
of
it
upon
her
cousin
saying
by
virtue
of
what
i
have
uttered
be
changed
from
thy
present
state
to
that
in
which
thou
wast
at
firstâand
instantly
he
shook
and
stood
upon
his
feet
rejoicing
in
his
liberation
and
exclaimed
i
testify101
that
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
that
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
god
bless
and
save
him
she
then
said
to
him
depart
and
return
not
hither
or
i
will
kill
theeâand
she
cried
out
in
his
face
so
he
departed
from
before
her
and
she
returned
to
the
áubbeh
and
said
o
my
master
come
forth
to
me
that
i
may
behold
thee
he
replied
with
a
weak
voice
what
hast
thou
done
thou
hast
relieved
me
from
the
branch
but
hast
not
relieved
me
from
the
rootâo
my
beloved
she
said
and
what
is
the
root
he
answered
the
people
of
this
city
and
of
the
four
islands
every
night
at
the
middle
hour
the
fish
raise
their
heads
and
imprecate
vengeance
upon
me
and
upon
thee
and
this
is
the
cause
that
preventeth
the
return
of
vigour
to
my
body
therefore
liberate
them
and
come
and
take
my
hand
and

said
to

with
joy
o

on
my

and
my
eye
in
the

she
sprang
up
full
of
happiness
and
hastened
to
the
lake
where
taking
a
little
of
its
water
she
pronounced
over
it
some
unintelligible
words
whereupon
the
fish
became
agitated
and
raised
their
heads
and
immediately
became
converted
into
men
as
before
thus
was
the
enchantment
removed
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
and
the
city
became
repeopled
and
the
market-streets
re-erected

every

returned

immediately
to

she
still
imagined
to

and
said
to
him
o
my
beloved
stretch
forth
thy
honoured
hand
that
i
may
kiss

me
said
the
king
in
a
low
voice
so
she
drew
near
to
him
and
he
having
his
keen-edged
sword
ready
in
his
hand
thrust
it
into
her
bosom
and
the
point
protruded
from
her
back
he
then
struck
her
again
and
clove
her
in
twain
and
went
forth

the
sultÃn
killing
the
enchantress
he
found
the
young
man
who
had
been
enchanted
waiting
his
return
and
congratulated
him
on
his
safety
and
the
young
prince
kissed
his
hand
and
thanked
him
the
king
then
said
to
him
wilt
thou
remain
in
thy
city
or
come
with
me
to
my
capitalâo
king
of
the
age
said
the
young
man
dost
thou
know
the
distance
that
is
between
thee
and
thy

the
king
answered
two
days
and
a
halfâo
king
replied
the
young
man
if
thou
hast
been
asleep

between
thee

a
distance

a
years
journey
to
him
who
travelleth
with

and
thou
camest
in
two
days
and
a
half
only
because
the
city
was
enchanted
but
o
king
i
will
never
quit
thee
for
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
king
rejoiced
at
his
words
and
said
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
in
his
beneficence
given
thee
to
me
thou
art
my
son
for
during
my
whole
life
i
have
never
been
blest
with
a
sonâand
they
embraced
each
other
and
rejoiced
exceedingly
they
then
went
together
into
the
palace
where
the
king
who
had
been
enchanted
informed
the
officers
of
his
court
that
he
was
about
to
perform
the
holy
pilgrimage
so
they
prepared
for
him
everything
that
he
required
and
he
departed
with
the
suláÃn
his
heart
burning
with
reflections
upon
his
city
because
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
sight
of
it
for
the
space
of
a
year

he
set
forth
accompanied
by
fifty
memlooks59
and
provided
with
presents
and
they
continued
their
journey
night
and
day
for
a
whole
year
after
which
they
drew
near
to
the
city
of
the
suláÃn
and
the
wezeer
and
the
troops
who
had
lost
all
hope
of
his
return
came
forth
to
meet
him
the
troops
approaching
him
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
congratulated
him
on
his
safe
return
and
he
entered
the
city
and
sat
upon
the
throne
he
then
acquainted
the
wezeer
with
all
that
had
happened
to
the
young
king
on
hearing
which
the
wezeer
congratulated
the
latter
also
on
his
safety
and
when
all
things
were
restored
to
order
the
suláÃn
bestowed
presents
upon
a
number
of
his
subjects
and
said
to
the
wezeer
bring
to
me
the
fisherman
who
presented
to
me
the
fish
so
he
sent
to
this
fisherman
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
restoration
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
enchanted
city103
and
brought
him
and
the
king
invested
him
with
a
dress
of
honour
and
inquired
of
him
respecting
his
circumstances
and
whether
he
had
any
children
the
fisherman
informed
him
that
he
had
a
son
and
two
daughters
and
the
king
on
hearing
this
took
as
his
wife
one
of
the
daughters
and
the
young
prince
married
the
other60
the
king
also
conferred
upon
the
son
the
office
of
treasurer
he
then
sent
the
wezeer
to
the
city
of
the
young
prince
the
capital
of
the
black
islands
and
invested
him
with
its
sovereignty
despatching
with
him
the
fifty
memlooks
who
had
accompanied
him
thence
with
numerous
robes
of
honour
to
all
the
emeers
and
the
wezeer
kissed
his
hands
and
set
forth
on
his
journey
while
the
suláÃn
and
the
young
prince
remained
and
as
to
the
fisherman
he
became
the
wealthiest
of
the
people
of
his
age
and
his
daughters
continued
to
be
the
wives
of
the
kings
until
they
died

a
whimsical
story
is
told
of
a
king
who
denied
to
poets
those
rewards
to
which
usage
had
almost
given
them
a
claim
this
king
whose
name
is
not
recorded
had
the
faculty
of
retaining
in
his
memory
an
ode
after
having
only
once
heard
it
and
he
had
a
memlook
who
could
repeat
an
ode
that
he
had
twice
heard
and
a
female
slave
who
could
repeat
one
that
she
had
heard
thrice
whenever
a
poet
came
to
compliment
him
with
a
panegyrical
ode
the
king
used
to
promise
him
that
if
he
found
his
verses
to
be
his
original
composition
he
would
give
him
a
sum
of
money
equal
in
weight
to
what
they
were
written
upon
the
poet
consenting
would
recite
his
ode
and
the
king
would
say
it
is
not
new
for
i
have
known
it
some
years
and
would
repeat
it
as
he
had
heard
it
after
which
he
would
add
and
this
memlook
also
retains
it
in
his
memory
and
would
order
the
memlook
to
repeat
it
which
having
heard
it
twice
from
the
poet
and
the
king
he
would
do
the
king
would
then
say
to
the
poet
i
have
also
a
female
slave
who
can
repeat
it
and
on
his
ordering
her
to
do
so
stationed
behind
the
curtains
she
would
repeat
what
she
had
thus
thrice
heard
so
the
poet
would
go
away
empty-handed
the
famous
poet
el-aámaee
having
heard
of
this
proceeding
and
guessing
the
trick
determined
upon
outwitting
the
king
and
accordingly
composed
an
ode
made
up
of
very
difficult
words
but
this
was
not
his
only
preparative
measure
another
will
be
presently
explained
and
a
third
was
to
assume
the
dress
of
a
bedawee
that
he
might
not
be
known
covering
his
face
the
eyes
only
excepted
with
a
lithÃm
a
piece
of
drapery
in
accordance
with
a
custom
of
arabs
of
the
desert
thus
disguised
he
went
to
the
palace
and
having
asked
permission
entered
and
saluted
the
king
who
said
to
him
whence
art
thou
o
brother
of
the
arabs
and
what
dost
thou
desire
the
poet
answered
may
god
increase
the
power
of
the
king
i
am
a
poet
of
such
a
tribe
and
have
composed
an
ode
in
praise
of
our
lord
the
suláÃnâo
brother
of
the
arabs
said
the
king
hast
thou
heard
of
our
conditionâno
answered
the
poet
and
what
is
it
o
king
of
the
ageâit
is
replied
the
king
that
if
the
ode
be
not
thine
we
give
thee
no
reward
and
if
it
be
thine
we
give
thee
the
weight
in
money
of
what
it
is
written
uponâhow
said
el-aámaee
should
i
assume
to
myself
that
which
belongs
to
another
and
knowing
too
that
lying
before
kings
is
one
of
the
basest
of
actions
but
i
agree
to
this
condition
o
our
lord
the
suláÃn
so
he
repeated
his
ode
the
king
perplexed
and
unable
to
remember
any
of
it
made
a
sign
to
the
memlookâbut
he
had
retained
nothing
and
called
to
the
female
slave
but
she
also
was
unable
to
repeat
a
word
o
brother
of
the
arabs
said
he
thou
hast
spoken
truth
and
the
ode
is
thine
without
doubt
i
have
never
heard
it
before
produce
therefore
what
it
is
written
upon
and
we
will
give
thee
its
weight
in
money
as
we
have
promisedâwilt
thou
said
the
poet
send
one
of
the
attendants
to
carry
itâto
carry
what
asked
the
king
is
it
not
upon
a
paper
here
in
thy
possessionâno
o
our
lord
the
suláÃn
replied
the
poet
at
the
time
i
composed
it
i
could
not
procure
a
piece
of
paper
upon
which
to
write
it
and
could
find
nothing
but
a
fragment
of
a
marble
column
left
me
by
my
father
so
i
engraved
it
upon
this
and
it
lies
in
the
court
of
the
palace
he
had
brought
it
wrapped
up
on
the
back
of
a
camel
the
king
to
fulfil
his
promise
was
obliged
to
exhaust
his
treasury
and
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
trick
of
which
he
afterwards
discovered
el-aámaee
to
have
been
the
author
in
future
rewarded
the
poets
according
to
the
usual
custom
of
kings156

the
following
case
is
also
related
as
an
exception
to
the
common
custom
of
great
men
with
regard
to
the
bestowal
of
rewards
on
poetsâa
poet
praised
a
governor
in
some
verses
and
the
latter
ordered
an
asss
bardaah
or
stuffed
saddle
and
girth
to
be
given
to
him
the
poet
went
away
with
them
on
his
shoulder
and
being
asked
what
he
had
got
answered
i
have
praised
our
honoured
lord
in
the
best
of
my
verses
and
he
hath
bestowed
on
me
some
of
the
most
magnificent
articles
of
his
apparel157

16âon
the
bath
the
áammÃm
or
bath
is
a
favourite
resort
of
both
men
108and
women
of
all
classes
among
the
muslims
who
can
afford
the
trifling
expense
which
it
requires
and
it
is
said
not
only
of
human
beings
but
also
of
evil
genii
on
which
account
as
well
as
on
that
of
decency
several
precepts
respecting
it
have
been
dictated
by
moáammad
it
is
frequented
for
the
purpose
of
performing
certain
ablutions
required
by
the
religion
or
by
a
regard
for
cleanliness
and
for
its
salutary
effects
and
for
mere
luxury

the
following
description
of
a
public
bath
will
convey
a
sufficient
notion
of
those
in
private
houses
which
are
on
a
smaller
scale
and
generally
consist
of
only
two
or
three
chambers
the
public
bath
comprises
several
apartments
with
mosaic
or
tesselated
pavements
composed
of
white
and
black
marble
and
pieces
of
fine
red
tile
and
sometimes
other
materials
the
inner
apartments
are
covered
with
domes
having
a
number
of
small
round
glazed
apertures
for
the
admission
of
light
the
first
apartment
is
the
meslakh
or
disrobing
room
which
has
in
the
centre
a
fountain
of
cold
water
and
next
the
walls
wide
benches
or
platforms
encased
with
marble
these
are
furnished
with
mattresses
and
cushions
for
the
higher
and
middle
classes
and
with
mats
for
the
poorer
sort
the
inner
division
of
the
building
in
the
more
regularly
planned
baths
occupies
nearly
a
square
the
central
and
chief
portion
of
it
is
the
principal
apartment
or
áarÃrah
which
generally
has
the
form
of
a
cross
in
its
centre
is
a
fountain
of
hot
water
rising
from
a
base
encased
with
marble
which
serves
as
a
seat
one
of
the
angles
of
the
square
is
occupied
by
the
beyt-owwal
or
antechamber
of
the
áarÃrah
in
another
is
the
fire
over
which
is
the
boiler
and
each
of
the
other
two
angles
is
generally
occupied
by
two
small
chambers
in
one
of
these
is
a
tank
filled
with
warm
water
which
pours
down
from
a
spout
in
the
dome
in
the
other
are
two
taps
side
by
side
one
of
hot
and
the
other
of
cold
water
with
a
small
trough
beneath
before
which
is
a
seat
the
inner
apartments
are
heated
by
the
steam
which
rises
from
the
fountain
and
tanks
and
by
the
contiguity
of
the
fire
but
the
beyt-owwal
is
not
so
hot
as
the
áarÃrah
being
separated
from
it
by
a
door
in
cold
weather
the
bather
undresses
in
the
former
which
has
two
or
three
raised
seats
like
those
of
the
meslakh

with
a
pair
of
wooden
clogs
to
his
feet
and
having
a
large
napkin
round
his
loins
and
generally
a
second
wound
round
his
head
like
a
turban
a
third
over
his
chest
and
a
fourth
covering
his
back
he
enters
the
áarÃrah
the
heat
of
which
causes
him
immediately
to
perspire
profusely
an
attendant
of
the
bath
removes
from
him
all
the
napkins
excepting
the
first
and
proceeds
to
crack
the
joints
of
his
fingers
and
toes
c
and
several
of
the
vertebrÃ
of
the
back
and
neck
kneads
his
flesh
and
rubs
the
soles
of
his
feet
with
a
coarse
earthen
rasp
and
his
limbs
and
body
with
a
woollen
bag
which
covers
his
hand
as
a
glove
after
which
the
bather
if
he
please
plunges
into
one
of
the
tanks
he
is
then
thoroughly
washed
with
soap
and
water
and
fibres
of
the
palm-tree
and
shaved
if
he
wish
it
in
one
of
the
small
chambers
which
contain
the
taps
of
hot
and
cold
water
and
returns
to
the
beyt-owwal
here
he
generally
reclines
upon
a
mattress
and
takes
some
light
refreshment
while
one
of
the
attendants
rubs
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
kneads
the
flesh
of
his
body
and
limbs
previously
to
his
resuming
his
dress
it
is
a
common
custom
now
to
take
a
pipe
and
a
cup
of
coffee
during
this
period
of
rest

the
women
are
especially
fond
of
the
bath
and
often
have
entertainments
there
taking
with
them
fruits
sweetmeats
c
and
sometimes
hiring
female
singers
to
accompany
them
an
hour
or
more
is
occupied
by
the
process
of
plaiting
the
hair
and
applying
the
depilatory
c
and
generally
an
equal
time
is
passed
in
the
enjoyment
of
rest
or
recreation
or
refreshment
all
necessary
decorum
is
observed
on
these
occasions
by
most
females
but
women
of
the
lower
orders
are
often
seen
in
the
bath
without
any
covering
some
baths
are
appropriated
solely
to
men
others
only
to
women
and
others
again
to
men
during
the
forenoon
and
in
the
afternoon
to
women
when
the
bath
is
appropriated
to
women
a
napkin
or
some
other
piece
of
drapery
is
suspended
over
the
door
to
warn
men
from
entering

before
the
time
of
moáammad
there
were
no
public
baths
in
arabia
and
he
was
so109
prejudiced
against
them
for
the
reasons
already
alluded
to
that
he
at
first
forbade
both
men
and
women
from
entering
them
afterwards
however
he
permitted
men
to
do
so
if
for
the
sake
of
cleanliness
on
the
condition
of
their
having
a
cloth
round
the
waist
and
women
also
on
account
of
sickness
child-birth
c
provided
they
had
not
convenient
places
for
bathing
in
their
houses
but
notwithstanding
this
license
it
is
held
to
be
a
characteristic
of
a
virtuous
woman
not
to
go
to
a
bath
even
with
her
husbands
permission
for
the
prophet
said
whatever
woman
enters
a
bath
the
devil
is
with
her
as
the
bath
is
a
resort
of
the
jinn
prayer
should
not
be
performed
in
it
nor
the
áur-Ãn
recited
the
prophet
said
all
the
earth
is
given
to
me
as
a
place
of
prayer
and
as
pure
except
the
burial-ground
and
the
bath158
hence
also
when
a
person
is
about
to
enter
a
bath
he
should
offer
up
an
ejaculatory
prayer
for
protection
against
evil
spirits
and
should
place
his
left
foot
first
over
the
thresholdâinfidels
have
often
been
obliged
to
distinguish
themselves
in
the
bath
by
hanging
a
signet
to
the
neck
or
wearing
anklets
c
lest
they
should
receive
those
marks
of
respect
which
should
be
paid
only
to
believers159

a
whole

stuffed
in
the

manner
as
the
fowls
above
mentioned
is
not
a
very
uncommon
dish
but
one
more
extraordinary
of
which
abd-el-laáeef
gives
an
account161
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
that
he
had
seen
in
egypt
i
am
tempted
to
describe
it
was
an
enormous
pie
composed
in
the
following
mannerâthirty
pounds
of
fine
flour
being
kneaded
with
five
pounds
and
a
half
of
oil
of
sesame
and
divided
into
two
equal
portions
one
of
these
was
spread
upon
a
round
tray
of
copper
about
four
spans
in
diameter
upon
this
were
placed
three
lambs
stuffed
with
pounded
meat
fried
with
oil
of
sesame
and
ground
pistachio-nuts
and
various
hot
aromatics
such
as
pepper
ginger
cinnamon
mastic
coriander-seed
cumin-seed
cardamom
nut
or
nutmeg
c
these
were
then
sprinkled
with
rose-water
infused
with
musk
and
upon
the
lambs
and
in
the
remaining
spaces
were
placed
twenty
fowls
twenty
chickens
and
fifty
smaller
birds
some
of
which
were
baked
and
stuffed
with
eggs
some
stuffed
with
meat
and
some
fried
with
the
juice
of
sour
grapes
or
that
of

to
the
above
were
added
a

some
filled
with
meat

with
sugar
and
sweetmeats
and
sometimes
the
meat
of
another
lamb
cut
into
small
pieces
and
some
fried
cheese
the
whole
being
piled
up
in
the
form
of
a

some
rose-water
infused
with
musk
and
aloes-wood
was
sprinkled
upon
it

of

is
a
pancake

is
made
very
thin

folded

generally
sweetened

is
also
another
common

which
somewhat
resembles
vermicelli

beverage
at
meals
is
water
which
is
drunk
from

porous
earthen
bottles

from
cups
of
brass

in

is
composed
of

after
every

that
a

drinks
he
says
praise
be

says
to
him
may
it
be
productive
of
enjoyment
to
which
he
replies
may
god
cause
thee
to
have
enjoyment
the
arabs
drink
little
or
no
water
during
a
meal
but
generally
take
a
large
draught
immediately
after
the
repast
is
quickly
finished
and
each
person
as
soon
as
he
has
done
says
praise

an
arab
historian
would
make
it
to
appear
that
the
intelligence
and
talent
ascribed
to
this
parrot
are
not
nearly
so
wonderful
as
those
which
some
birds
have
been
known
to
display

mentions
a
parrot
which
recited
the
soorat

chapter
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
a
raven

recited

this
not

hunting
and
hawking
hunting
and
hawking
which
were
common
and
favourite
diversions
of
the
arabs
and
especially
of
their
kings
and
other
great
men
have
now
fallen
into
comparative
disuse
among
this
people
they
are
however
still
frequently
practised
by
the
persians
and
in
a
manner
the
same
as
they
are
generally
described
in
the
present
work
sir
john
malcolm
was
informed
that
these
sports
were
nowhere
found
in
greater
perfection
than
in
the
neighbourhood
of
aboo-shahr
where
he
witnessed
and
took
part
in
them
i
shall
therefore
here
avail
myself
of
his
observations
on
this
subject

the
huntsmen
he
says
proceed
to
a
large
plain
or
rather
desert
near
the
sea-side
they
have
hawks
and
greyhounds
the
former
carried
in
the
usual
manner
on
the
hand
of
the
huntsman
the
latter
led
in
a
leash
by
a
horseman
generally
the
same
who
carries
the
hawk
when
the
antelope
is
seen
they
endeavour
to
get
as
near
as
possible
but
the
animal
the
moment
it
observes
them
goes
off
at
a
rate
that
seems
swifter
than
the
wind
the
horsemen
are
instantly
at
full
speed
having
slipped
the
dogs
if
it
is
a
single
deer
they
at
the
same
time
fly
the
hawks
but
if
a
herd
they
wait
till
the
dogs
have
fixed
on
a
particular
antelope
the
hawks
skimming
along
near
the
ground
soon
reach
the
deer
at
whose
head
they
pounce
in
succession
and
sometimes
with
a
violence
that
knocks
it
over
they
are
commonly
described
as
pecking
at
the
poor
creatures
eyes
until
they
blind
it
at
all
events
they
confuse
the
animal
so
much
as
to
stop
its
speed
in
such
a
degree
that
the
dogs
can
come
up
with
it
and
in
an
instant
men
horses
dogs
and
hawks
surround
the
unfortunate
deer
against
which
their
united
efforts
have
been
combined
the
part
of
the
chase
that
surprised
me
most
was
the
extraordinary
combination
of
the
hawks
and
the
dogs
which
throughout
seemed
to
look
to
each
other
for
aid
this
i
was
told
was
the
result
of
long
and
skilful
trainingâthe
antelope
is
supposed
to
be
the
fleetest
quadruped
on
earth
and
the
rapidity
of
the
first
burst
of
the
chase
i
have
described
is
astonishing
the
run
seldom
exceeds
three
or
four
miles
and
often
is
not
half
so
much
a
fawn
is
an
easy
victory
the
doe
often
runs
a
good
chase
and
the
buck
is
seldom
taken
the
arabs
are
indeed
afraid
to
fly
their
hawks
at
the
latter
as
these
fine
birds
in
pouncing
frequently
impale
themselves
on
its
sharp
hornsâthe
hawks
used
in
this
sport
are
of
a
species
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
country
this
breed
which
is
called
cherkh
is
not
large
but
of
great
beauty
and
symmetry

another
mode
of
running
down
the
antelope
is
practised
here
and
still
more
in
the
interior
of
persia
persons
of
the
highest
rank
lead
their
own
greyhounds
in
a
long
silken
leash
which
passes
through
the
collar
and
is
ready
to
slip
the
moment
the
huntsman
chooses
the
well-trained
dog
goes
alongside
the
horse
and
keeps
clear
of
him
when
at
full
speed
and
in
all
kinds
of
country
when
a
herd
of
antelopes
is
seen
a
consultation
is
held
and
the
most
experienced
determine
the
point
towards
which
113
they
are
to
be
driven
the
field
as
an
english
sportsman
would
term
it
then
disperse
and
while
some
drive
the
herd
in
the
desired
direction
those
with
the
dogs
take
their
post
on
the
same
line
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
from
each
other
one
of
the
worst
dogs
is
then
slipped
at
the
herd
and
from
the
moment
he
singles
out
an
antelope
the
whole
body
are
in
motion
the
object
of
the
horsemen
who
have
greyhounds
is
to
intercept
its
course
and
to
slip
fresh
dogs
in
succession
at
the
fatigued
animal
in
rare
instances
the
second
dog
kills
it
is
generally
the
third
or
fourth
and
even
these
when
the
deer
is
strong
and
the
ground
favourable
often
fail
this
sport
which
is
very
exhilarating
was
the
delight
of
the
late
king
of
persia
ÃghÃ

moáammad
khÃn
whose
taste
is
inherited
by
the
present
sovereign

the
novelty
of
these
amusements
interested
me
and
i
was
pleased
on
accompanying
a
party
to
a
village
about
twenty
miles
from
aboo-shahr
to
see
a
species
of
hawking
peculiar
i
believe
to
the
sandy
plains
of
persia
on
which
the
áobÃrÃ

a
noble
species
of
bustard
is
found
on
almost
bare
plains
where
it
has
no
shelter
but
a
small
shrub
called
geetuck
when
we
went
in
quest
of
them
we
had
a
party
of
about
twenty
all
well
mounted
two
kinds
of
hawks
are
necessary
for
this
sport
the
first
the
cherkh
the
same
which
is
flown
at
the
antelope
attacks
them
on
the
ground
but
will
not
follow
them
on
the
wing
for
this
reason
the
bhyree
a
hawk
well
known
in
india
is
flown
the
moment
the
áobÃrÃ

risesâas
we
rode
along
in
an
extended
line
the
men
who
carried
the
cherkhs
every
now
and
then
unhooded
and
held
them
up
that
they
might
look
over
the
plain
the
first
áobÃrÃ

we
found
afforded
us
a
proof
of
the
astonishing
quickness
of
sight
of
one
of
the
hawks
he
fluttered
to
be
loose
and
the
man
who
held
him
gave
him
a
whoop
as
he
threw
him
off
his
hand
and
set
off
at
full
speed
we
all
did
the
same
at
first
we
only
saw
our
hawk
skimming
over
the
plain
but
soon
perceived
at
a
distance
of
more
than
a
mile
the
beautiful
speckled
áobÃrÃ

with
his
head
erect
and
wings
outspread
running
forward
to
meet
his
adversary
the
cherkh
made
several
unsuccessful
pounces
which
were
either
evaded
or
repelled
by
the
beak
or
wings
of
the
áobÃrÃ

which
at
last
found
an
opportunity
of
rising
when
a
bhyree
was
instantly
flown
and
the
whole
party
were
again
at
full
gallop
we
had
a
flight
of
more
than
a
mile
when
the
áobÃrÃ

alighted
and
was
killed
by
another
cherkh
who
attacked
him
on
the
ground
this
bird
weighed
ten
pounds
we
killed
several
others
but
were
not
always
successful
having
seen
our
hawks
twice
completely
beaten
during
the
two
days
we
followed
this
fine
sport165

the
hunting
of
the
wild
ass
is
another
sport
of
the
persians
and
arabs
but
one
of
a
more
difficult
nature
this
animal
is
found
in
syria
and
in
the
nubian
deserts
as
well
as
in
arabia
and
persia
the
more
common
kinds
of
game
are
gazelles
or
antelopes
hares
partridges
the
species
of
grouse
called
áaáÃ

quails
wild
geese
ducks
c
against
all
of
these
the
hawk
is
generally
employed
but
assisted
in
the
capture
of
gazelles
and
hares
by
dogs
the
usual
arms
of
the
sportsmen
in
the
times
to
which
the
present
work
relates
were
the
bow
and
arrow
the
cross-bow
the
spear
the
sword
and
the
mace
when
the
game
is
struck
down
but
not
killed
by
any
weapon
its
throat
is
immediately
cut
if
merely
stunned
and
then
left
to
die
its
flesh
is
unlawful
food
some
other
laws
respecting
the
killing
of
game
have
been
mentioned
in
a
former
note
but
one
has
been
there
omitted
which
is
worthy
of
remark
though
it
is
often
disregarded
it
is
that
hunting
is
allowable
only
for
the
purpose

sides

gaps
are
purposely
left

gap
a

near

rivulet
or
spring
to

in

the
gazelles
resort
when
the

is
to

many
peasants
assemble
and
watch

they
see
a

gazelles
advancing
from

poetical

first
of
these
is
as

o

commit
thine
affairs
unto
him
who
spread
out

28âthe
fable
of
the
crocodile
perhaps
the
reader
may
desire
to
know
what
is
the
story
which
the
sage
doobÃn
declined
to
relate
i
will
therefore
supply
the
omission
as
well
as
my
memory
will
allow
me
i
have
heard
this
fable
differently
told
by
different
persons
and
it
is
sometimes
spun
out
to
a
considerable
length
but
the
principal
points
of
it
are
theseâa
crocodile
having
crawled
far
from
the
nile
over
a
desert
tract
found
his
strength
so
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
thirst
that
he
despaired
of
being
able
to
return
to
the
river
while
he
was
in
this
unhappy
state
an
arab
with
his
camel
approached
him
proceeding
in
the
desired
direction
and
he
appealed
to
his
compassion
entreating
that
he
would
bind
him
on
the
back
of
the
camel
and
so
convey
him
to
the
nile
and
promising
that
he
would
afterwards
in
return
for
this
favour
carry
him
across
to
the
opposite
bank
the
arab
answered
that
he
feared
the
crocodile
would
as
soon
as
he
was
unbound
turn
upon
him
and
devour
him
but
the
monster
swore
so
solemnly
that
he
would
gratefully
requite
the
service
he
requested
that
the
man
was
induced
to
consent
and
making
his
camel
lie
down
bound
the
crocodile
firmly
upon
his
back
and
brought
him
to
the
bank
of
the
river
no
sooner
however
was
the
horrid
creature
liberated
than
in
spite
of
his
vows
he
opened
his
hideous
jaws
to
destroy
his
benefactor
who
though
he
eluded
this
danger
was
unable
to
rescue
his
camel
at
this
moment
a
fox
drew
near
them
the
man
accosting
this
cunning
animal
related
his
tale
and
the
crocodile
urged
in
his
own
excuse
that
the
man
had
spitefully
bound
him
on
the
back
of
the
camel
in
such
a
manner
that
he
had
almost
killed
him
the
fox
replied
that
he
could
quickly
pursue
and
capture
the
man
115
but
that
he
must
act
fairly
and
first
see
the
whole
transaction
repeated
before
him
the
crocodile
assenting
and
submitting
to
have
a
noose
thrown
over
his
jaws
was
again
bound
on
the
back
of
the
camel
and
taken
to
the
place
whence
he
was
brought
and
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
man
by
the
direction
of
the
fox
holding
with
one
hand
the
halter
of
his
camel
with
the
other
cut
the
ropes
which
secured
his
burden
and
hasted
away
with
his
beast
leaving
the
ungrateful
and
treacherous
monster
in
the
same
hopeless
state
in
which
he
had
found
him

this
comparison
is
perfectly
just
my
first
visit
to
egypt
was
not
too
late
for
me
to
witness
such
a
scene
as
that
which
is
here
alluded
to
but
now
throughout
the
turkish
dominions
the
officers
of
government
are
obliged
more
or
less
to
assimilate
their
style
of
dress
to
that
which
commonly
prevails
in
europe
gaudy
colours
are
out
of
fashion
among
them
and
silk
embroidery
is
generally
preferred
to
gold
in
egypt
however
the
dress
worn
by
this
class
of
persons
has
not
been
so
much
altered
as
in
turkey
still
retaining
an
oriental
character
though
wanting
the
shawl
which
was
wound
round
the
red
cap
and
formed
the
turban
while
the
dress
worn
by
other
classes
has
undergone
no
change
this
note
still
applies
to
the
inhabitants
of
egypt
with
the
exception
of
the
turks
who
have
very
generally
adopted
the
modern
turkish
or
semi-european

as
a
thing
worn
on
the
head
so
called
because
of
its
roundness
and
this
is
the
only
description
of
it
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
i
was
told
in
cairo
that
koofeeyeh
is
the
correct
appellation
of
the
head-kerchief
commonly
called
keffeeyeh
but
this
is
a
mistake
the
latter
is
a
square
kerchief
which
is
worn
on
the
head
measuring
about
a
yard
in
each
direction
and
of
various
colours
generally
a
dull
brownish
red
bright
green

yellow
composing
broad
and
narrow
stripes
and
having
a
deep
fringe
of
strings
and
tassels
along

most
common
kind
is
entirely
of
cotton
another
of
cotton
interwoven
with
silk
and
a
third
of
silk
interwoven
with
gold
it
is
now
chiefly
worn
by
the
wahhÃbees

several
tribes
of
bedawees
but
116
the
former
wear
only
the
first
kind

they
hold
articles
of
dress
composed
wholly
or
partly
of
silk

unlawful
in

it
was
in
common
use
among
the
inhabitants
of
the

it
is
mostly
worn
by
men
and
is
doubled
diagonally
and
placed
over
the
cap
in
such
a
manner
that
the
two
corners
which
are
folded
together
hang
down
the
back
and
the
other
two
corners
in
front
a
piece
of
woollen
rope
or
a
strip

generally
wound
round

usually
hang
down

are
sometimes
turned
up
and
tucked

the
inhabitants
of
the

usually
wear
the

burckhardt
who
calls
this
head-kerchief
keffie
mentions
that
the
bedawees
of
mekkeh

tie
over
it
instead
of
the
woollen
rope

is
used
by
the
northern
bedawees
a

made
of
wax
tar
and
butter
strongly
kneaded
together
this
he
adds
is
pressed
down
to
the
middle
of
the
head
and
looks
like
the
airy
crown
of
a
saint
it
is
about
the
thickness
of
a
finger
and
they
take
it
off
very
frequently
to
press
it
between
their
hands
so
that
its
shape
may
be
preserved168
the
better
kinds
of
keffeeyeh

36âanecdote
of
a
miraculous
fish
this
story
of
the
miraculous
fish
reminds
me
of
one
of
a
similar
kind
which
is
related
as
authentic
a
certain
just
judge
of
the
israelites
in
the
time
of
solomon
had
a
wife
who
every
time
that
she
brought
him
his
food
used
to
ejaculate
a
prayer
that
disgrace
might
befall
every
unfaithful
wife
one
day
this
woman
having
placed
before
her
husband
a
fried
fish
and
repeated
her
usual
ejaculation
the
fish
leaped
from
the
dish
and
fell
upon
the
floor
this
happened
three
times
and
in
consequence
of
a
suspicion
expressed
by
a
devotee
who
was
consulted
respecting
the
meaning
of
this
strange
event
the
judge
discovered
that
a
supposed
maid
whom
he
had
purchased
as
a
slave
was
a
disguised
man169

at
the
entrance
or
a
little
within
it
from
seeing
into
the
court
it
usually
has
two
turnings
we
may
therefore
understand
the
motive
of
the
king
in
seating
himself
in
the
place
here
described
to
have
been
a
desire
that
he
might
not

be
supposed
to
be
prying
impertinently
into
the
interior
of
the
palace
respect
for
the
privacy
of

is
a
point
that
is
deemed
of
so
much
importance
that
it
is
insisted
upon
in

these
wordsâo
ye

have
become

enter
not
any

your

until
ye
shall
have
asked

the
word
which
i
have
here
rendered
wine
namely
sharÃb
is
applied
to
any
drink
and
particularly
to
a
sweet
beverage
but
in
the
present
case
the
context
shews
that
its
signification
is
that
which
i
have
given
it
the
description
of
a
carousal
in
the
next
chapter
will
present
a
more
fit
occasion
for
my
considering
at
large
the
custom
of
drinking
wine
as
existing
among
the
arabs

the
use
of
hemp
to
induce
intoxication
the
name
of
benj
or

believe
generally
given
to
henbane

el-áazweenee
states
that
the

hemp
áinneb
bustÃnee
or
shahdÃnaj
are
the
benj

when
eaten
disorders
the
reason
this
is
an
important
confirmation
of
de
sacys
opinion
respecting
the
derivation
of
the
appellation
of
assassins
from
áashshÃsheen
hemp-eaters
or
persons
who
intoxicate
themselves
with
hemp
as
the
sect
which
we
call
assassins
are
expressly
said
by
the
arabs
to
have
made
frequent
use
of
benj171
118
to
this
subject
i
shall
have
occasion
to
revert
i
need
only
add
here
that
the
custom
of
using
benj
and
other
narcotics
for
purposes
similar
to
that
described
in
this
tale
is
said
to
be
not
very
unfrequently
practised
in
the
present
day
but
as
many
arab
husbands
are
extremely
suspicious
of
the
character
of
women
in
general
perhaps
there
is
but
little
ground
for
this
assertion

it

to

the

to
encircle
our
earth
as
mentioned
in
a
former
note
it
is
also
the
name
of
the
chain
of
caucasus
and
hence
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
fable
respecting
the
mountains
before
mentioned
originated
from
an
early
idea
that
the
chain
of
caucasus
was
the
limit
of
the
habitable
earth
but
it
is
possible
that
the

mountains
may
have
derived
their
name
from
an
imaginary
resemblance

el-boáeyreh
on
the
west
of
the
western
branch
of
the

the
extraordinary
abundance
of
these
animals

throughout
egypt
gave
rise
to
an
absurd
fable
which
is
related
by
diodorus
siculus172
as
a
matter
worthy
of
serious
considerationâthat
these
creatures
are
generated
from
the
alluvial
soil
deposited
by
the
nile
the
inundation
drives
many
of
them
from
the
fields
to
the

deserts
and
destroys
the
rest

soon
after
the
waters
have
subsided

numbers
of

are
seen
again
taking
refuge

it

the

appears
to
have
been
a
custom
of
both
sexes
among
the
arabs
in
earlier
times
for
the
black
clothing
which
distinguished
the
abbÃsee
khaleefehs
and
their
officers
was
originally
assumed
in
testimony
of
grief
for
the
death
of
the
imÃm
ibrÃheem
ibn-moáammad
it
has
however
ceased
to
be
worn
by
men
as
indicating
a
want
of
resignation
to
the
decrees
of
providence
and
is
only
assumed
by

occasion
of
the
death
of

or
near
relation

not
for
an
elderly

they
dye
their
shirts
head-veils
face-veils

handkerchiefs
of

sometimes
with
the

stain
their

this

notice

of
those
which
assist

to
form
some
opinion
respecting
the
period

the
present
work
in
the
states
in
which
it
is
known
to
us
was
composed
or
compiled
or
remodelled
it
is
the
same
in
all
the
copies
of
the
original
work
that
i
have
seen
and
bears
strong
evidence
of
having
been
written
subsequently
to
the
commencement
of
the
eighth
century
of
the
flight
or
fourteenth
of
our
era
at
which
period
it
appears
the
christians
and
jews
were
first
compelled
to
distinguish
themselves
by
wearing
respectively
blue
and
yellow
turbans
in
accordance
with
an
order
issued
by
the
sultÃn
of
egypt
moáammad
ibn-kala-oon174
thus
the
white
turban
became
peculiar
to
the
muslimsâan
eminent
german
critic
has
been
unfortunate
in
selecting
the
incident
of
the
four
fish
as
affording
an
argument
in
favour
of
his
opinion
that
the
tales
of
a
thousand
and
one
nights
are
of
indian
origin
on
the
mere
ground
that
the
same
word
varna
is
used
in
sanscrit
to
signify
both
colour
and
caste

note
56
the
muslims
often
implore
the
intercession
of
their
prophet
and
of
various
members
of
his
family
and
other
holy
persons
though
their
ordinary
prayers
are
addressed
solely
to
god
the
regard
which
they
pay
to
their
reputed
saints
both
living
and
deceased
as
mediators
is
one
of
the
heresies
which
the
wahhÃbees
most
vehemently
condemn

58
in
the
first

i
have

that
it

the
muslims
to
repeat
this
phrase
in
the
name
of
god
on
commencing
every
lawful
action
that
is
of
any
importance
it
is
therefore
here
employed
as
it
is
in
many
similar
cases
to
express
a
readiness
to
do
what
is
commanded
or
requested
and
is
equivalent
to
saying
i
this
instant
begin
to
execute
thy
orders

eastern
histories
present
numerous
instances
of
marriages
as
unequal
as
those

related
the

as
inconsistent

of

there
was
a
man
of

was
unmarried

he
was
a
porter
and
one
day
as
he
sat
in
the
market
reclining
against
his
crate1
there
accosted
him
a
female
wrapped
in
an
izÃr2
of
the
manufacture
of
el-mÃáil3
composed
of
gold-embroidered
silk
with
a
border
of
gold
lace
at
each
end
who
raised
her
face-veil
and
displayed
beneath
it
a
pair
of
black
eyes
with
lids
bordered
by
long
lashes
exhibiting
a
tender
expression
and
features
of
perfect
beauty
and
she
said
with
a
sweet
voice
bring
thy
crate
and
follow
me121

the
porter
had
scarcely
heard
her
words
when
he
took
up
his
crate
and
he
followed
her
until
she
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
house
and
knocked
whereupon
there
came
down
to
her
a
christian
and
she
gave
him
a
piece
of
gold
and
received
for
it
a
quantity
of
olives
and
two
large
vessels
of
wine4
which
she
placed
in
the
crate
saying
to
the
porter
take
it
up
and
follow

the
porter
exclaimed
this
is
indeed
a
fortunate
dayâand
he
took
up
the
crate
and
followed
her
she
next
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
fruiterer
and
bought
of
him
syrian
apples
and
othmÃnee
quinces5
and
peaches
of
omÃn
and
jasmine
of

water-lilies

these
she
put
into

said
to
him
take

up
so
he
took
it
up
and
followed
her
until
she
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
butcher
to
whom
she
said
cut
off
ten
pounds
of
meatâand
he
cut
it
off
for
her
and
she
wrapped
it
in
a
leaf
of
a
banana-tree
and
put
it
in
the
crate
and
said
again
take
it
up
o
porterâand
he
did
so
and
followed
her
she
next
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
seller
of
dry
fruits
and
took
some
of
every
kind
of
these
and
desired
the
porter
to
take
up
his
burden
having
obeyed
he
followed
her
until
she
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
confectioner
where
she
bought
a
dish
and
filled
it
with
sweets
of
every
kind
that
he
had6
which
she
put
into
the
crate
whereupon
the
porter
ventured
to
say
if
thou
hadst
informed
me
beforehand
i
had
brought
with
me
a
mule
to
carry
all
these
things
the
lady
smiled
at
his
remark
and
next
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
perfumer
of
whom
she
bought
ten
kinds
of
scented
waters
rose-water
and
orange-flower-water
and
willow-flower-water7
c
together
with
some
sugar
and
a
sprinkling-bottle8
of

some
frankincense
and
aloes-wood
and
ambergris
and
musk
and
wax
candles
and
placing
all
these
in
the
crate
she
said
take
up
thy
crate
and
follow
me
he
therefore
took
it
up
and
followed
her
until
she
came
to
a
handsome
house
before
which
was
a
spacious
court
it
was
a
lofty
structure
with
a
door
of
two
leaves
composed
of

the
young
lady
stopped
at
this
door
and
knocked
gently
whereupon
both
its
leaves
were
opened
and
the
porter
looking
to
see
who
opened
it
found
it
to
be
a
damsel
of
tall
stature
high-bosomed
fair
and
beautiful
and
of

its
splendour
and
the
forms
of
her
bosom
resembled

when
the
porter
beheld
her
she
captivated
his

the
crate
nearly
fell
from
his

he
exclaimed

constructed
with
carved
wood-work
and
fountains
and
benches
of
different
kinds
and
closets
with
curtains
hanging
before
them
there
was
also
in
it
at
the
upper
end13
a
couch
of
alabaster
inlaid
with
large
pearls
and
jewels
with
a
musquito-curtain
of
red
satin
suspended
over
it
and
within
this
was
a
young
lady
with
eyes
possessing
the
enchantment
of
bÃbil14
and
a
figure
like
the
letter
alif15
with
a
face
that
put
to
shame
the
shining
sun
she
was
like
one
of
the
brilliant
planets
or
rather
one
of
the
most
high-born
of
the
maidens
of
arabia
this
third
lady16
rising
from
the
couch
advanced
with
a
slow
and
elegant
gait
to
the
middle
of
the
saloon
where
her
sisters
were
standing
and
said
to
them
why
stand
ye
still
lift
down
the
burden
from
the
head
of
this
poor
porterâwhereupon
the
cateress
placed
herself
before
him
and
the
portress
behind
him
and
the
third
lady
assisting
them
they
lifted
it
down
from
his
head
they
then
took
out
the
contents
of
the
crate
and
having
put
every
thing
in
its
place
gave
to
the
porter
two
pieces
of
gold
saying
to
him
depart
o
porter

the
porter
however
stood
looking
at
the
ladies
and
admiring
their
beauty
and
their
agreeable
dispositions
for
he
had
never
seen
any
more
handsome
and
when
he
observed
that
they
had
not
a
man
among
them
and
gazed
upon
the
wine
and
fruits
and
sweet-scented
flowers
which
were
there
he
was
full
of
astonishment
and
hesitated
to
go
out
upon
which
one
of
the
ladies
said
to
him
why
dost
thou
not
go
dost
thou
deem
thy
hire
too
little
then
turning
to
one
of
her
sisters
she
said
to
her
give
him
another
piece
of
goldâby
allah
o
my
mistress
exclaimed
the
porter
my
hire
is
but
two
half-dirhems17
and
i
thought
not
what
ye
have
given
me
too
little
but
my
heart
and
mind
were
occupied
with
reflections
upon
you
and
your
state
ye
being
alone
with
no
man
among
you
not
one
to
amuse
you
with
his
company
for
ye
know
that
the
menÃreh18
standeth
not
firmly
but
on
four
walls
now
ye
have
not
a
fourth
and
the
pleasure
of
women
is
not
complete
without
men
ye
are
three
only
and
have
need
of
a
fourth123
who
should
be
a
man
a
person
of
sense
discreet
acute
and
a
concealer
of
secrets
we
are
maidens
they
replied
and
fear
to
impart
our
secret
to
him
who
will
not
keep
it
for
we
have
read
in
a
certain
history
this
verseâ

guard
thy
secret
from
another
intrust
it
not
for
he
who
intrusteth
a
secret
hath
lost
it
the
porter
pleading
with
the
three
ladies
âby
your
existence
said
the
porter
i
am
a
man
of
sense
and
trustworthy
i
have
read
various
books
and
perused
histories
i
make
known
what
is
fair
and
conceal
what
is
foul
and
act
in
accordance
with
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

none
keepeth
a
secret
but
a
faithful
person
with
the
best
of
mankind
it
remaineth
concealed
a
secret
is
with
me
as
in
a
house
with
a
lock
whose
key
is
lost
and
whose
door
is
sealed19
when
the
ladies
heard
the
verses
which
he
quoted
and
the
words
with
which
he
addressed
them
they
said
to
him
thou
knowest
that
we
have
expended
here
a
considerable
sum
of
money
hast
thou
then
wherewith
to
requite
us
we
will
not
suffer
thee
to
remain
with
us124
unless
thou
contribute
a
sum
of
money
for
thou
desirest
to
sit
with
us
and
to
be
our
cup-companion
and
to
gaze
upon
our
beautiful
facesâif
friendship
is
without
money
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
it
is
not
equivalent
to
the
weight
of
a
grainâand
the
portress
added
if
thou
hast
nothing
depart
with
nothingâbut
the
cateress
said
o
sister
let
us
suffer
him
for
verily
he
hath
not
been
deficient
in
his
services
for
us
this
day
another
had
not
been
so
patient
with
us
whatever
therefore
falls
to
his
share
of
the
expense
i
will
defray
for
himâat
this
the
porter
rejoiced
and
exclaimed
by
allah
i
obtained
my
first
and
only
pay
this
day
from
none
but
theeâand
the
other
ladies
said
to
him
sit
down
thou
art
welcome

the
cateress
then
arose
and
having
tightened
her
girdle
arranged
the
bottles
and
strained
the
wine
and
prepared
the
table
by
the
pool
of
the
fountain
she
made
ready
all
that
they
required
brought
the
wine
and
sat
down
with
her
sisters
the
porter
also
sitting
with
them
thinking
he
was
in
a
dream
and
when
they
had
seated
themselves
the
cateress
took
a
jar
of
wine
and
filled
the
first
cup
and
drank
it20
she
then
filled
another
and
handed
it
to
one
of
her
sisters
and
in
like
manner
she
did
to
her
other
sister
after
which
she
filled
again
and
handed
the
cup
to
the
porter
who
having
taken
it
from
her
hand
repeated
this
verseâ

i
will
drink
the
wine
and
enjoy
health
for
verily
this
beverage
is
a
remedy
for
disease
the
porter
and
ladies
carousing
the
wine
continued
to
circulate
among
them
and
the
porter
taking
his
part
in
the
revels
dancing
and
singing
with
them
and
enjoying125
the
fragrant
odours
began
to
hug
and
kiss
them
while
one
slapped21
him
and
another
pulled
him
and
the
third
beat
him
with
sweet-scented
flowers
till
at
length
the
wine
made
sport
with
their
reason
and
they
threw
off
all
restraint
indulging
their
merriment
with
as
much
freedom
as
if
no
man
had
been
present22

thus
they
continued
until
the
approach
of
night
when
they
said
to
the
porter
depart
and
shew
us
the
breadth
of
thy
shoulders23âbut
he
replied
verily
the
departure
of
my
soul
from
my
body
were
more
easy
to
me
than
my
departure
from
your
company
therefore
suffer
us
to
join
the
night
to
the
day
and
then
each
of
us
shall
return
to
his
own
or
her
own
affairs
the
cateress
also
again
interceded
for
him
saying
by
my
life
i
conjure
you
that
ye
suffer
him
to
pass
the
night
with
us
that
we
may
laugh
at
his
drolleries
for
he
is
a
witty
rogue
so
they
said
to
him
thou
shalt
pass
the
night
with
us
on
this
condition
that
thou
submit
to
our
authority
and
ask
not
an
explanation
of
anything
that
thou
shalt
see
he
replied
goodârise
then
said
they
and
read
what
is
inscribed
upon
the
door
accordingly
he
went
to
the
door
and
found
the
following
inscription
upon
it
in
letters
of
gold
speak
not
of
that
which
doth
not
concern
thee
lest
thou
hear
that
which
will
not
please
theeâand
he
said
bear
witness
to
my
promise
that
i
will
not
speak
of
that
which
doth
not
concern
me

the
three
royal
mendicants
the
cateress
then
rose
and
prepared
for
them
a
repast
and
after
they
had
eaten
a
little
they
lighted
the
candles
and
burnt
some
aloes-wood
this
done
they
sat
down
again
to
the
table
and
while
they
were
eating
and
drinking
they
heard
a
knocking
at
the
door
whereupon
without
causing
any
interruption
to
their
meal
one
of
them
went
to
the
door
and
on
her
return
said
our
pleasure
this
night
is
now
complete
for
i
have
found
at
the
door
three
foreigners24
with
shaven
chins
and
each
of
them
is
blind
of
the
left
eye
it
is
an
extraordinary
coincidence
they
are
strangers
newly
arrived25
and
each
of
them
has
a
ridiculous
appearance
if
they
come
in
therefore
we
shall
be
amused
with
laughing
at
themâthe
lady
ceased
not
with
these
words
but
continued
to
persuade
her
sisters
until
they
consented
and
said
let
them
enter
but
make
it
a
condition
with
them
that
they
speak
not
of
that
which
doth
not
concern
them
lest
they
hear
that
which
will
not
please
them
upon
this
she
rejoiced
and
having
gone
again
to
the
door
brought
in
the
three
men
blind
of
one
eye
and
with
shaven
chins
and
they
had
thin
and
twisted
mustaches
being
mendicants
they
saluted
and
drew
back
but
the
ladies
rose
to
them
and126
seated
them
and
when
these
three
men
looked
at
the
porter
they
saw
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
observing
him
narrowly
they
thought
that
he
was
one
of
their
own
class
and
said
he
is
a
mendicant
like
ourselves
and
will
amuse
us
by
his
conversationâbut
the
porter
hearing
what
they
said
arose
and
rolled
his
eyes
and
exclaimed
to
them
sit
quiet
and
abstain
from
impertinent
remarks
have
ye
not
read
the
inscription
upon
the
doorâthe
ladies
laughing
said
to
each
other
between
the
mendicants
and
the
porter
we
shall
find
matter
for
amusement
they
then
placed
before
the
former
some
food
and
they
ate
and
then
sat
to
drink
the
portress
handed
to
them
the
wine
and
as
the
cup
was
circulating
among
them
the
porter
said
to
them
brothers
have
ye
any
tale
or
strange
anecdote
wherewith
to
amuse
us
the
mendicants
heated
by
the
wine
asked
for
musical
instruments
and
the
portress
brought
them
a
tambourine
of
the
manufacture
of
el-mÃáil
with
a
lute
of
el-erÃá
and
a
persian
harp26
whereupon
they127
all
arose
and
one
took
the
tambourine
another
the
lute
and
the
third
the
harp
and
they
played
upon
these
instruments
the
ladies
accompanying
them
with
loud
songs
and
while
they
were
thus
diverting
themselves
a
person
knocked
at
the
door
the
portress
therefore
went
to
see
who
was
there
and
the
cause
of
the
knocking
was
this

the
concert
of
the
mendicants
the
khaleefeh27
hÃroon
er-rasheed
had
gone
forth
this
night
to
see
and
hear
what
news
he
could
collect
accompanied
by
jaáºfar28
his
wezeer
and
mesroor29
his
executioner
it
was
his
custom
to
disguise
himself
in
the
attire
of
a
merchant
and
this
night
as
he
went
through
the
city
he
happened
to
pass
with
his
attendants
by
the
house
of
these
ladies
and
hearing
the
sounds
of
the
musical
instruments
he
said
to
jaáºfar
i
have
a
desire
to
enter
this
house
and
to
see
who
is
giving
this
concertâthey
are
a
party
who
have
become
intoxicated
replied
jaáºfar
and
i
fear
that
we
may
experience
some
ill
usage
from
themâbut
the
khaleefeh
said
we
must
enter
and
i
would
that
thou
devise
some
stratagem
by
which
we
may
obtain
admission
to
the
inmates
jaáºfar
therefore
answered
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
advanced
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
the
portress
came
and
opened
the
door
he
said
to
her
my
mistress
we
are
merchants
from
tabareeyeh30
and
have
been
in
baghdÃd
ten
days
we
have
brought
with
us
merchandise
and
taken
lodgings
in
a
khÃn31
and
a
merchant
invited
us
to
an
entertainment
this
night
accordingly
we
went
to
his
house
and
he
placed
food
before
us
and
we
ate
and
sat
awhile
drinking
together
after
which
he
gave
us
leave
to
depart32
and
going
out128
in
the
dark
and
being
strangers
we
missed
our
way
to
the
khÃn
we
trust
therefore
in
your
generosity
that
you
will
admit
us
to
pass
the
night
in
your
house
by
doing
which
you
will
obtain
a
reward
in
heavenâthe
portress
looking
at
them
and
observing
that
they
were
in
the
garb
of
merchants
and
that
they
bore
an
appearance
of
respectability
returned
and
consulted
her
two
companions
and
they
said
to
her
admit
themâso
she
returned
and
opened
to
them
the
door
they
said
to
her
shall
we
enter
with
thy
permission
she
answered
come
in
the
khaleefeh
therefore
entered
with
jaáºfar
and
mesroor
and
when
the
ladies
saw
them
they
rose
to
them
and
served
them
saying
welcome
are
our
guests
but
we
have
a
condition
to
impose
upon
you
that
ye
speak
not
of
that
which
doth
not
concern
you
lest
ye
hear
that
which
will
not
please
you
they
answered
goodâand
when
they
had
sat
down
to
drink
the
khaleefeh
looked
at
the
three
mendicants
and
was
surprised
at
observing
that
each
of
them
was
blind
of
the
left
eye
and
he
gazed
upon
the
ladies
and
was
perplexed
and
amazed
at
their
fairness
and
beauty
and
when
the
others
proceeded
to
drink
and
converse
the
ladies
brought
wine
to
the
khaleefeh
but
he
said
i
am
a
pilgrim33âand
drew
back
from
them
whereupon
the
portress
spread
before
him
an
embroidered
cloth
and
placed
upon
it
a
china
bottle
into
which
she
poured
some
willow-flower-water
adding
to
it
a
lump
of
ice
and
sweetening
it
with
sugar
while
the
khaleefeh
thanked
her
and
said
within
himself
to-morrow
i
must
reward
her
for
this
kind
action

the
party
continued
their
carousal
and
when
the
wine
took
effect
upon
them
the
mistress
of
the
house
arose
and
waited
upon
them
and
afterwards
taking
the
hand
of
the
cateress
said
arise
o
my
sister
that
we
may
fulfil
our
debt
she
replied
good
the
portress
then
rose
and
after
she
had
cleared
the
middle
of
the
saloon
placed
the
mendicants
at
the
further
end
beyond
the
doors
after
which
the
ladies
called
to
the
porter
saying
how
slight
is
thy
friendship
thou
art
not
a
stranger
but
one
of
the
family
so
the
porter
arose
and
girded
himself
and
said
what
would
yeâto
which
one
of
the
ladies
answered
stand
where
thou
artâand
presently
the
cateress
said
to
him
assist
meâand
he
saw
two
black
bitches
with
chains
attached
to
their
necks
and
drew
them
to
the
middle
of
the
saloon
whereupon
the
mistress
of
the
house
arose
from
her
place
and
tucked
up
her
sleeve
above
her
wrist
and
taking
a
whip
said
to
the
porter
bring
to
me
one
of
them
accordingly
he
dragged
one
forward
by
the
chain
the
bitch
whined
and
shook
her
head
at
the
lady
but
the
latter
fell129
to
beating
her
upon
the
head
notwithstanding
her
howling
until
her
arms
were
tired
when
she
threw
the
whip
from
her
hand
and
pressed
the
bitch
to
her
bosom
and
wiped
away
her
tears
and
kissed
her
head
after
which
she
said
to
the
porter
take
her
back
and
bring
the
otherâand
he
brought
her
and
she
did
to
her
as
she
had
done
to
the
first
at
the
sight
of
this
the
mind
of
the
khaleefeh
was
troubled
and
his
heart
was
contracted
and
he
winked
to
jaáºfar
that
he
should
ask
her
the
reason
but
he
replied
by
a
sign
speak
not

the
ladies
preparing
to
whip
the
bitches
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
looked
towards
the
portress
and
said
to
her
arise
to
perform
what
thou
hast
to
do
she
replied
goodâand
the
mistress
of
the
house
seated
herself
upon
a
couch
of
alabaster
overlaid
with
gold
and
silver
and
said
to
the
portress
and
the
cateress
now
perform
your
parts
the
portress
then
seated
herself
upon
a
couch
by
her
and
the
cateress
having
entered
a
closet
brought
out
from
it
a
bag
of
satin
with
green
fringes
and
placing
herself
before
the
lady
of
the
house
shook
it
and
took
out
from
it
a
lute
and
she
tuned
its
strings
and
sang
to
it
these
versesâ

restore
to
my
eyelids
the
sleep
which
hath
been
ravished
and
inform
me
of
my
reason
whither
it
hath
fled
i
discovered
when
i
took
up
my
abode
with
love
that
slumber
had
become
an
enemy
to
my
eyes
they
said
we
saw
thee
to
be
one
of
the
upright
what
then
hath
seduced
thee
i
answered
seek
the
cause
from
his
glance
verily
i
excuse
him
for
the
shedding
of
my
blood
admitting
that
i
urged
him
to
the
deed
by
vexation
he
cast
his
sun-like
image
upon
the
mirror
of
my
mind
and
its
reflection
kindled
a
flame
in
my
vitals34
when
the
portress35
had
heard
this
song
she
exclaimed
allah
approve
theeâand
she
rent
her
clothes
and
fell
upon
the
floor
in
a
swoon
and
when
her
bosom
was
thus
uncovered
the
khaleefeh
saw
upon
her
the
marks
of
beating
as
if
from
miáraahs36
and
whips
at130
which
he
was
greatly
surprised
the
cateress37
immediately
arose
sprinkled
water
upon
her
face
and
brought
her
another
dress
which
she
put
on
the
khaleefeh
then
said
to
jaáºfar
seest
thou
not
this
woman
and
the
marks
of
beating
upon
her
i
cannot
keep
silence
respecting
this
affair
nor
be
at
rest
until
i
know
the
truth
of
the
history
of
this
damsel
and
that
of
these
two
bitches
but
jaáºfar
replied
o
our
lord
they
have
made
a
covenant
with
us
that
we
shall
not
speak
excepting
of
that
which
concerneth
us
lest
we
hear
that
which
will
not
please
usâthe
cateress
then
took
the
lute
again
and
placing
it
against
her
bosom
touched
the
chords
with
the
ends
of
her
fingers
and
thus
sang
to
itâ

the
portress
fainting
131

if
of
love
we
complain
what
shall
we
say
or
consuming
through
desire
how
can
we
escape
or
if
we
send
a
messenger
to
interpret
for
us
he
cannot
convey
the
lovers
complaint
or
if
we
would
be
patient
short
were
our
existence
after
the
loss
of
those
we
love
nought
remaineth
to
us
but
grief
and
mourning
and
tears
streaming
down
our
cheeks
o
you
who
are
absent
from
my
sight
but
constantly
dwelling
within
my
heart
have
you
kept
your
faith
to
an
impassioned
lover
who
while
time
endureth
will
never
change
or
in
absence
have
you
forgotten
that
lover
who
on
your
account
is
wasting
away
when
the
day
of
judgment
shall
bring
us
together
i
will
beg
of
our
lord
a
protractive
trial38
on
hearing
these
verses
of
the
cateress
the
portress
again
rent
her
clothes
and
cried
out
and
fell
upon
the
floor
in
a
swoon
and
the
cateress
as
before
put
on
her
another
dress
after
she
had
sprinkled
some
water
upon
her
face39

the
mendicants
when
they
witnessed
this
scene
said
would
that
we
had
never
entered
this
house
but
rather
had
passed
the
night
upon
the
mounds40
for
our
night
hath
been
rendered
foul
by
an
event
that
breaketh
the
back
the
khaleefeh
looking
towards
them
then
said
wherefore
is
it
so
with
you
they
answered
our
hearts
are
troubled
by
this
occurrenceâare
ye
not
he
asked
of
this
houseâno
they
answered
nor
did
we
imagine
that
this
house
belonged
to
any
but
the
man
who
is
sitting
with
youâupon
which
the
porter
said
verily
i
have
never
seen
this
place
before
this
night
and
i
would
that
i
had
passed
the
night
upon
the
mounds
rather
than
here
they
then
observed
one
to
another
we
are
seven
men
and
they
are
but
three
women
we
will
therefore
ask
them
of
their
history
and
if
they
answer
us
not
willingly
they
shall
do
it
in
spite
of
themselvesâand
they
all
agreed
to
this
excepting
jaáºfar
who
said
this
is
not
a
right
determination
leave
them
to
themselves
for
we
are
their
guests
and
they
made
a
covenant
with
us
which
we
should
fulfil
there
remaineth
but
little
of
the
night
and
each
of
us
shall
soon
go
his
way
then
winking
to
the
khaleefeh
he
said
there
remaineth
but
an
hour
and
to-morrow
we
will
bring
them
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
ask
them
their
story
but
the
khaleefeh
refused
to
do
so
and
said
i
have
not
patience
to
wait
so
long
for
their
historyâwords
followed
words
and
at
last
they
said
who
shall
put
the
question
to
themâand
one
answered
the
porter

the
porter
seized
the
ladies
then
said
to
them
o
people
of
what
are
ye
talkingâwhereupon
the
porter
approached
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
said132
to
her
o
my
mistress
i
ask
thee
and
conjure
thee
by
allah
to
tell
us
the
story
of
the
two
bitches
and
for
what
reason
thou
didst
beat
them
and
then
didst
weep
and
kiss
them
and
that
thou
acquaint
us
with
the
cause
of
thy
sisters
having
been
beaten
with
miáraahs
that
is
our
question
and
peace
be
on
youâis
this
true
that
he
saith
of
you
inquired
the
lady
of
the
other
men
and
they
all
answered
yesâexcepting
jaáºfar
who
was
silent
when
the
lady
heard
their
answer
she
said
verily
o
our
guests
ye
have
wronged
us
excessively
for
we
made
a
covenant
with
you
beforehand
that
he
who
should
speak
of
that
which
concerned
him
not
should
hear
that
which
would
not
please
him
is
it
not
enough
that
we
have
admitted
you
into
our
house
and
fed
you
with
our
provisions
but
it
is
not
so
much
your
fault
as
the
fault
of
her
who
introduced
you
to
usâshe
then
tucked
up
her
sleeve
above
her
wrist
and
struck
the
floor
three
times
saying
come
ye
quicklyâand
immediately
the
door
of
a
closet
opened
and
there
came
forth
from
it
seven
black
slaves
each
having
in
his
hand
a
drawn
sword
the
lady
said
to
them
tie
behind
them
the
hands
of
these
men
of
many
words
and
bind
each
of
them
to
anotherâand
they
did
so
and
said
o
virtuous
lady
dost
thou
permit
us
to
strike
off133
their
heads
she
answered
give
them
a
short
respite
until
i
shall
have
inquired
of
them
their
histories
before
ye
behead
themâby
allah
o
my
mistress
exclaimed
the
porter
kill
me
not
for
the
offence
of
others
for
they
have
all
transgressed
and
committed
an
offence
excepting
me
verily
our
night
had
been
pleasant
if
we
had
been
preserved
from
these
mendicants
whose
presence
is
enough
to
convert
a
well-peopled
city
into
a
heap
of
ruinsâhe
then
repeated
this
coupletâ

how
good
is
it
to
pardon
one
able
to
resist
and
how
much
more
so
one
who
is
helpless
for
the
sake
of
the
friendship
that
subsisted
between
us
destroy
not
one
for
the
crime
of
another
on
hearing
these
words
of
the
porter
the
lady
laughed
after
her
anger
then
approaching
the
men
she
said
acquaint
me
with
your
histories
for
there
remaineth
of
your
lives
no
more
than
an
hour
were
ye
not
persons
of
honourable
and
high
condition
or
governors41
i
would
hasten
your
recompenseâthe
khaleefeh
said
to
jaáºfar
wo
to
thee
o
jaáºfar
make
known
to
her
who
we
are
otherwise
she
will
kill
usâit
were
what
we
deserve
replied
heâjesting
said
the
khaleefeh
is
not
befitting
in
a
time
for
seriousness
each
has
its
proper
occasionâthe
lady
then
approached
the
mendicants
and
said
to
them
are
ye
brothers
they
answered
no
indeed
we
are
only
poor
foreigners42
she
said
then
to
one
of
them
wast
thou
born
blind
of
one
eyeâno
verily
he
answered
but
a
wonderful
event
happened
to
me
when
my
eye
was
destroyed
and
the
story
of
it
if
engraved
on
the
understanding
would
serve
as
a
lesson
to
him
who
would
be
admonished
she
asked
the
second
and
the
third
also
and
they
answered
her
as
the
first
adding
each
of
us
is
from
a
different
country
and
our
history
is
wonderful
and
extraordinary
the
lady
then
looked
towards
them
and
said
each
of
you
shall
relate
his
story
and
the
cause
of
his
coming
to
our
abode
and
then
stroke
his
head43
and
go
his
way

the
first
who
advanced
was
the
porter
who
said
o
my
mistress
i
am
a
porter
and
this
cateress
loaded
me
and
brought
me
hither
and
what
hath
happened
to
me
here
in
your
company
ye
know
this
is
my
story
and
peace
be
on
youâstroke
thy
head
then
said
she
and
goâbut
he
replied
by
allah
i
will
not
go
until
i
shall
have
heard
the
story
of
my
companionsâthe
first
mendicant
then
advanced
and
related
as
followsâ

134

the
story
of
the
first
royal
mendicant

know
o
my
mistress
that
the
cause
of
my
having
shaved
my
beard
and
of
the
loss
of
my
eye
was
thisâmy
father
was
a
king
and
he
had
a
brother
who
was
also
a
king
and
who
resided
in
another
capital
it
happened
that
my
mother
gave
birth
to
me
on
the
same
day
on
which
the
son
of
my
uncle
was
born
and
years
and
days
passed
away
until
we
attained
to
manhood
now
it
was
my
custom
some
years
to
visit
my
uncle
and
to
remain
with
him
several
months
and
on
one
of
these
occasions
my
cousin
paid
me
great
honour
he
slaughtered
sheep
for
me
and
strained
the
wine
for
me
and
we
sat
down
to
drink
and
when
the
wine
had
affected
us
he
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
i
have
need
of
thine
assistance
in
an
affair
of
interest
to
me
and
i
beg
that
thou
wilt
not
oppose
me
in
that
which
i
desire
to
do
i
replied
i
am
altogether
at
thy
serviceâand
he
made
me
swear
to
him
by
great
oaths
and
rising
immediately
absented
himself
for
a
little
while
and
then
returned
followed
by
a
woman
decked
with
ornaments
and
perfumed
and
wearing
a
dress
of
extraordinary
value
he
looked
towards
me
while
the
woman
stood
behind
him
and
said
take
this
woman
and
go
before
me
to
the
burial-ground
which
is
in
such
a
placeâand
he
described
it
to
me
and
i
knew
it
he
then
added
enter
the
burial-ground
and
there
wait
for
me

i
could
not
oppose
him
nor
refuse
to
comply
with
his
request
on
account
of
the
oaths
which
i
had
sworn
to
him
so
i
took
the
woman
and
went
with
her
to
the
burial-ground
and
when
we
had
sat
there
a
short
time
my
cousin
came
bearing
a
basin
of
water
and
a
bag
containing
some
plaster
and
a
small
adze
going
to
a
tomb
in
the
midst
of
the
burial-ground
he
took
the
adze
and
disunited
the
stones
which
he
placed
on
one
side
he
then
dug
up
the
earth
with
the
adze
and
uncovered
a
flat
stone
of
the
size
of
a
small
door
under
which
there
appeared
a
vaulted
staircase
having
done
this
he
made
a
sign
to
the
woman
and
said
to
her
do
according
to
thy
choiceâwhereupon
she
descended
the
stairs
he
then
looked
towards
me
and
said
o
son
of
my
uncle
complete
thy
kindness
when
i
have
descended
into
this
place
by
replacing
the
trap-door
and
the
earth
above
it
as
they
were
before
then
this
plaster
which
is
in
the
bag
and
this
water
which
is
in
the
basin
do
thou
knead
together
and
plaster
the
stones
of
the
tomb
as
they
were
so
that
no
man
may
know
it
and
say
this
hath
been
lately
opened
but
its
interior
is
oldâfor135
during
the
space
of
a
whole
year
i
have
been
preparing
this
and
no
one
knew
it
but
god
this
is
what
i
would
have
thee
do
he
then
said
to
me
may
god
never
deprive
thy
friends
of
thy
presence
o
son
of
my
uncleâand
having
uttered
these
words
he
descended
the
stairs

first
prince
afterwards
a
mendicant
leading
the
lady
to
the
tomb
when
he
had
disappeared
from
before
my
eyes
i
replaced
the
trap-door
and
busied
myself
with
doing
as
he
had
ordered
me
until
the
tomb
was
restored
to
the
state
in
which
it
was
at
first
after
which
i
returned
to
the
palace
of
my
uncle
who
was
then
absent
on
a
hunting
excursion
i
slept
that
night
and
when
the
morning
came
i
reflected
upon
what
had
occurred
between
me
and
my
cousin
and
repented
of
what
i
had
done
for
him
when
repentance
was
of
no
avail
i
then
went
out
to
the
burial-ground
and
searched
for
the
tomb
but
could
not
discover
it
i
ceased
not
in
my
search
until
the
approach
of
night
and
not
finding
the
way
to
it
returned
again
to
the
palace
and
i
neither
ate
nor
drank
my
heart
was
troubled
respecting
my
cousin
since
i
knew
not
what
had
become
of
him
and
i
fell
into136
excessive
grief
i
passed
the
night
sorrowful
until
the
morning
and
went
again
to
the
burial-ground
reflecting
upon
the
action
of
my
cousin
and
repenting
of
my
compliance
with
his
request
and
i
searched
among
all
the
tombs
but
discovered
not
that
for
which
i
looked
thus
i
persevered
in
my
search
seven
days
without
success44

my
trouble
continued
and
increased
until
i
was
almost
mad
and
i
found
no
relief
but
in
departing
and
returning
to
my
father
but
on
my
arrival
at
his
capital
a
party
at
the
city-gate
sprang
upon
me
and
bound
me
i
was
struck
with
the
utmost
astonishment
considering
that
i
was
the
son
of
the
suláÃn
of
the
city
and
that
these
were
the
servants
of
my
father
and
of
myself
excessive
fear
of
them
overcame
me
and
i
said
within
myself
what
hath
happened
to
my
father
i
asked
of
those
who
had
bound
me
the
cause
of
this
conduct
but
they
returned
me
no
answer
till
after
a
while
when
one
of
them
who
had
been
my
servant
said
to
me
fortune
hath
betrayed
thy
father
the
troops
have
been
false
to
him
and
the
wezeer
hath
killed
him
and
we
were
lying
in
wait
to
take
theeâthey
took
me
and
i
was
as
one
dead
by
reason
of
this
news
which
i
had
heard
respecting
my
father
and
i
stood
before
the
wezeer
who
had
killed
my
father

now
there
was
an
old
enmity
subsisting
between
me
and
him
and
the
cause
of
it
was
thisâi
was
fond
of
shooting
with
the
cross-bow
and
it
happened
one
day
that
as
i
was
standing
on
the
roof
of
my
palace
a
bird
alighted
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
of
the
wezeer
who
was
standing
there
at
the
time
and
i
aimed
at
the
bird
but
the
bullet
missed
it
and
struck
the
eye
of
the
wezeer
and
knocked
it
out
in
accordance
with
the
appointment
of
fate
and
destiny
as
the
poet
hath
saidâ

we
trod
the
steps
appointed
for
us
and
the
man
whose
steps
are
appointed
must
tread
them
he
whose
death
is
decreed
to
take
place
in
one
land
will
not
die
in
any
land
but
that
when
i
had
thus
put
out
the
eye
of
the
wezeer
he
could
say
nothing
because
my
father
was
king
of
the
city
this
was
the
cause
of
the
enmity
between
him
and
me
and
when
i
stood
before
him
with
my
hands
bound
behind
me
he
gave
the
order
to
strike
off
my
head
i
said
to
him
wouldst
thou
kill
me
for
no
offenceâwhat
offence
he
exclaimed
could
be
greater
than
thisâand
he
pointed
to
the
place
of
the
eye
which
was
put
out
i
did
that
said
i
unintentionally137
he
replied
if
thou
didst
it
unintentionally
i
will
do
the
same
to
thee
purposelyâand
immediately
he
said
bring
him
forward
to
meâand
when
they
had
done
so
he
thrust
his
finger
into
my
left
eye
and
pulled
it
out
thus
i
became
deprived
of
one
eye
as
ye
see
me
he
then
bound
me
firmly
and
placed
me
in
a
chest
and
said
to
the
executioner
take
this
fellow
and
draw
thy
sword
and
convey
him
without
the
city
then
put
him
to
death
and
let
the
wild
beasts
devour
him

accordingly
he
went
forth
with
me
from
the
city
and
having
taken
me
out
from
the
chest
bound
hand
and
foot
was
about
to
bandage
my
eye
and
kill
me
whereupon
i
wept
and
exclaimedâ

how
many
brothers
have
i
taken
as
armour
and
such
they
were
but
to
guard
my
enemies
i
thought
they
would
be
as
piercing
arrows
and
such
they
were
but
to
enter
my
heart
the
executioner
who
had
served
my
father
in
the
same
capacity
and
to
whom
i
had
shewn
kindnesses
said
on
hearing
these
verses
o
my
master
what
can
i
do
being
a
slave
under
commandâbut
presently
he
added
depart
with
thy
life
and
return
not
to
this
country
lest
thou
perish
and
cause
me
to
perish
with
thee
the
poet
saithâ

flee
with
thy
life
if
thou
fearest
oppression
and
leave
the
house
to
tell
its
builders
fate
thou
wilt
find
for
the
land
that
thou
quittest
another
but
no
soul
wilt
thou
find
to
replace
thine
own
as
soon
as
he
had
thus
said
i
kissed
his
hands
and
believed
not
in
my
safety
until
i
had
fled
from
his
presence
the
loss
of
my
eye
appeared
light
to
me
when
i
considered
my
escape
from
death
and
i
journeyed
to
my
uncles
capital
and
presenting
myself
before
him
informed
him
of
what
had
befallen
my
father
and
of
the
manner
in
which
i
had
lost
my
eye
upon
which
he
wept
bitterly
and
said
thou
hast
added
to
my
trouble
and
my
grief
for
thy
cousin
hath
been
lost
for
some
days
and
i
know
not
what
hath
happened
to
him
nor
can
any
one
give
me
information
respecting
him
then
he
wept
again
until
he
became
insensible
and
when
he
recovered
he
said
o
my
son
the
loss
of
thine
eye
is
better
than
the
loss
of
thy
life

upon
this
i
could
no
longer
keep
silence
respecting
his
son
my
cousin
so
i
informed
him
of
all
that
happened
to
him
and
on
hearing
this
news
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
said
shew
me
the
tombâby
allah
o
my
uncle
i
replied
i
know
not
where
it
is
for138
i
went
afterwards
several
times
to
search
for
it
and
could
not
recognise
its
place
we
however
went
together
to
the
burial-ground
and
looking
to
the
right
and
left
i
discovered
it
and
both
i
and
my
uncle
rejoiced
i
then
entered
the
tomb
with
him
and
when
we
had
removed
the
earth
and
lifted
up
the
trap-door
we
descended
fifty
steps
and
arriving
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
there
issued
forth
upon
us
a
smoke
which
blinded
our
eyes
whereupon
my
uncle
pronounced
those
words
which
relieve
from
fear
him
who
uttereth
themâthere
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
greatâafter
this
we
proceeded
and
found
ourselves
in
a
saloon
filled
with
flour
and
grain
and
various
eatables
and
we
saw
there
a
curtain
suspended
over
a
couch
upon
which
my
uncle
looked
and
found
there
his
son
and
the
woman
who
had
descended
with
him
lying
side
by
side
and
converted
into
black
charcoal
as
if
they
had
been
thrown
into
a
pit
of
fire
and
when
he
beheld
this
spectacle
he
spat
in
his
sons
face
and
exclaimed
this
is
what
thou
deservest
o
thou
wretch
this
is
the
punishment
of
the
present
world
and
there
remaineth
the
punishment
of
the
other
world
which
will
be
more
severe
and
lastingâand
he
struck
him
with
his
shoes
astonished
at
this
action
and
grieved
for
my
cousin
seeing
him
and
the
damsel
thus
converted
into
charcoal
i
said
by
allah
o
my
uncle
moderate
the
trouble
of
thy
heart
for
my
mind
is
perplexed
by
that
which
hath
happened
to
thy
son
and
by
thinking
how
it
hath
come
to
pass
that
he
and
the
damsel
are
converted
into
black
charcoal
dost
thou
not
deem
it
enough
for
him
to
be
in
this
state
that
thou
beatest
him
with
thy
shoes

o
son
of
my
brother
he
replied
this
my
son
was
from
his
early
years
inflamed
with
love
for
his
foster-sister45
and
i
used
to
forbid
him
from
entertaining
this
passion
for
her
and
to
say
within
myself
they
are
now
children
but
when
they
grow
older
a
base
act
will
be
committed
by
themâand
indeed
i
heard
that
such
had
been
the
case
but
i
believed
it
not
i
however
reprimanded
him
severely
and
said
to
him
beware
of
so
foul
an
action
which
none
before
thee
hath
committed
nor
will
any
commit
after
thee
otherwise
we
shall
suffer
disgrace
and
disparagement
among
the
kings
until
we
die
and
our
history
will
spread
abroad
with
the
caravans
have
a
care
for
thyself
that
such
an
action
proceed
not
from
thee
for
i
should
be
incensed
against
thee
and
kill
thee
i
then
separated
him
from
her
and
her
from
him
but
the
vile
woman
loved
him
excessively
the
devil
got
possession
of
them
both
and
when
my
son
saw
that
i
had
separated
him
he
secretly
made
this
place
beneath
the
earth
and
having
con139veyed
hither
the
provisions
which
thou
seest
took
advantage
of
my
inadvertence
when
i
had
gone
out
to
hunt
and
came
hither
but
the
truth46
whose
perfection
be
extolled
and
whose
name
be
exalted
was
jealously
vigilant
over
them
and
consumed
them
by
fire
and
the
punishment
of
the
world
to
come
will
be
more
severe
and
lastingâhe
then
wept
and
i
wept
with
him
and
he
said
to
me
thou
art
my
son
in
his
steadâi
remained
a
while
reflecting
upon
the
world
and
its
vicissitudes
upon
the
murder
of
my
father
by
the
wezeer
and
his
usurping
his
throne
and
the
loss
of
my
eye
and
the
strange
events
which
had
happened
to
my
cousin
and
i
wept
again

we
then
ascended
and
having
replaced
the
trap-door
and
the
earth
above
it
and
restored
the
tomb
to
its
former
state
returned
to
our
abode
but
scarcely
had
we
seated
ourselves
when
we
heard
the
sounds
of
drums
and
trumpets
warriours
galloped
about
and
the
air
was
filled
with
dust
raised
by
the
horses
hoofs
our
minds
were
perplexed
not
knowing
what
had
happened
and
the
king
asking
the
news
was
answered
the
wezeer
of
thy
brother
hath
slain
him
and
his
soldiers
and
guards
and
come
with
his
army
to
assault
the
city
unawares
and
the
inhabitants
being
unable
to
withstand
have
submitted
to
himâwhereupon
i
said
within
myself
if
i
fall
into
his
hand
he
will
slay
meâgriefs
overwhelmed
me
and
i
thought
of
the
calamities
which
had
befallen
my
father
and
my
mother
and
knew
not
what
to
do
for
if
i
appeared
the
people
of
the
city
would
know
me
and
the
troops
of
my
father
would
hasten
to
kill
and
destroy
me
i
knew
no
way
of
escape
but
to
shave
off
my
beard47
so
i
shaved
it
and
having
changed
my
clothes
departed
from
the
city
and
came
hither
to
this
abode
of
peace
in
the
hope
that
some
person
would
introduce
me
to
the
prince
of
the
faithful
the
khaleefeh
of
the
lord
of
all
creatures
that
i
might
relate
to
him
my
story
and
all
that
had
befallen
me
i
arrived
in
this
city
this
night
and
as
i
stood
perplexed
not
knowing
whither
to
direct
my
steps
i
saw
this
mendicant
and
saluted
him
and
said
i
am
a
stranger
he
replied
and
i
too
am
a
strangerâand
while
we
were
thus
addressing
each
other
our
companion
this
third
person
came
up
to
us
and
saluting
us
said
i
am
a
stranger
we
replied
and
we
also
are
strangers
so
we
walked
on
together
and
darkness
overtook
us
and
destiny
directed
us
unto
your
abodeâthis
was
the
cause
of
the
shaving
of
my
beard
and
of
the
loss
of
my
eye

the
lady
then
said
to
him
stroke
my
head
and
departâbut
he
replied
i
will
not
depart
until
i
have
heard
the
stories
of
the
others140
and
they
wondered
at
his
tale
and
the
khaleefeh
said
to
jaáºfar
verily
i
have
never
known
the
like
of
that
which
hath
happened
to
this
mendicant

the
second
mendicant
then
advanced
and
having
kissed
the
ground
saidâ

the
story
of
the
second
royal
mendicant

o
my
mistress
i
was
not
born
with
only
one
eye
but
my
story
is
wonderful
and
if
written
would
serve
as
a
lesson
to
him
who
would
be
admonished
i
am
a
king
and
son
of
a
king
i
read
the
áurÃn
according
to
the
seven
readings48
and
perused
various
works
under
the
tuition
of
different
learned
professors
of
their
subjects
i
studied
the
science
of
the
stars49
and
the
writings
of
the
poets
and
made
myself
a
proficient
in
all
the
sciences
so
that
i
surpassed
the
people
of
my
age
my
hand-writing50
was
extolled
among
all
the
scribes
my
fame
spread
among
all
countries
and
my
history
among
all
kings
and
the
king
of
india
hearing
of
me
requested
my
father
to
allow
me
to
visit
him
sending
him
various
gifts
and
curious
presents
such
as
were
suitable
to
kings
my
father
therefore
prepared
for
me
six
ships
and
we
proceeded
by
sea
for
the
space
of
a
whole
month
after
which
we
came
to
land
and
having
disembarked
some
horses
which
we
had
with
us
in
the
ship
we
loaded
ten
camels
with
presents
and
commenced
our
journey
but
soon
there
appeared
a
cloud
of
dust
which
rose
and
spread
until
it
filled
the
air
before
us
and
after
a
while
cleared
a
little
and
discovered
to
us
in
the
midst
of
it
sixty141
horseman
like
fierce
lions
whom
we
perceived
to
be
arab
highwaymen
and
when
they
saw
us
that
we
were
a
small
company
with
ten
loads
of
presents
for
the
king
of
india
they
galloped
towards
us
pointing
their
spears
at
us
we
made
signs
to
them
with
our
fingers
and
said
we
are
ambassadors
to
the
honoured
king
of
india
therefore
do
us
no
injuryâbut
they
replied
we
are
not
in
his
territories
nor
under
his
government
they
slew
certain
of
the
young
men
and
the
rest
fled
i
also
fled
after
i
had
received
a
severe
wound
the
arabs
being
employed
without
further
regard
to
us
in
taking
possession
of
the
treasure
and
presents
which
we
had
with
us

second
prince
afterwards
a
mendicant
meeting
the
robbers
i
proceeded
without
knowing
whither
to
direct
my
course
reduced
from
a
mighty
to
an
abject
state
and
journeyed
till
i
arrived
at
the
summit
of
a
mountain
where
i
took
shelter
in
a
cavern
until
the
next
morning
i
then
resumed
my
journey
and
arrived
at
a
flourishing
city
the
winter
with
its
cold
had
passed
away
and
the
spring
had
come
with
its
flowers
and
i
rejoiced
at
my
arrival
there
being
wearied
with
my
journey
anxious
and
pallid
my
condition
being
thus
changed
i
knew
not
whither
to
bend
my
steps
and
turning
to
a
tailor
sitting
in
his
shop
i
saluted
him
and
he
returned
my
salutation
and
welcomed
me
and
wished
me
joy
asking
me
the
reason
of
my
having
come
thither
i
acquainted
him
therefore
with
what
had
befallen
me
from
first
to
last
and
he
was
grieved
for
me
and
said
o
young
man
reveal
not
thy
case
for
i
fear
what
the
king
of
this
city
might
do
to
thee
since
he
is
the
greatest
of
thy
fathers
enemies
and
hath
a
debt
of
blood
against
him
he
then
placed
some
food
and
drink
before
me
and
we
ate
together
and
i
conversed
with
him
till
night
when
he
lodged
me
in
a
place
by
his
shop
and
brought
me
a
bed
and
coverlet
and
after
i
had
remained
with
him
three
days
he
said
to
me
dost
thou
not
know
any
trade
by
which
to
make
gain51
i
answered
i
am
acquainted
with
the
law
a
student
of
sciences
a
writer
and
an
arithmeticianâthy
occupation
he
said
is
profitless
in
our
country
there
is
no
one
in
our
city
acquainted
with
science
or
writing
but
only
with
getting
money
verily
i
replied
i
know
nothing
but
what
i
have
told
theeâgird
thyself
then
said
he
and
take
an
axe
and
a
rope
and
cut
firewood
in
the
desert
and
so
obtain
thy
subsistence
until
god
dispel
thy
affliction
but
acquaint
no
one
with
thy
history
else
they
will
kill
thee
he
then
bought
for
me
an
axe
and
a
rope
and
sent
me
with
a
party
of
wood-cutters
giving
them
a
charge
respecting
me
accordingly
i
went
forth
with
them
and
cut
some
wood
and
brought
back
a
load
upon
my
head
and
sold
it142
for
half
a
piece
of
gold
part
of
which
i
expended
in
food
laying
by
the
remainder

second
prince
as
a
wood-cutter
second
prince
discovering
the
trap-door
thus
i
continued
for
the
space
of
a
year
after
which
i
went
one
day
into
the
desert
according
to
my
custom
to
cut
firewood
and
finding
there
a
tract
with
abundance
of
wood
i
entered
it
and
came
to
a
tree
around
which
i
dug
and
as
i
was
removing
the
earth
from
its
roots
the
axe
struck
against
a
ring
of
brass
and
i
cleared
away
the
earth
from
it
and
found
that
it
was
affixed
to
a
trap-door
of
wood
which
i
immediately
removed
beneath
it
appeared
a
staircase
which
i
descended
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
i
entered
a
door
and
beheld
a
palace
strongly
constructed
where
i
found
a
lady
like
a
pearl
of
high
price
whose
aspect
banished
from
the
heart
all
anxiety
and
grief
and
affliction
at
the
sight
of
her
i
prostrated
myself
in
adoration
of143
her
creator
for
the
fairness
and
beauty
which
he
had
displayed
in
her
person
and
she
looking
towards
me
said
art
thou
a
man
or
a
jinnee
i
answered
her
i
am
a
manâand
who
she
asked
hath
brought
thee
to
this
place
in
which
i
have
lived
five
and
twenty
years
without
ever
seeing
a
human
beingâher
words
sounded
sweetly
to
me
and
i
answered
her
o
my
mistress
god
hath
brought
me
to
thy
abode
and
i
hope
will
put
an
end
to
my
anxiety
and
griefâand
i
related
to
her
my
story
from
beginning
to
end
she
was
grieved
at
my
case
and
wept
and
said
i
also
will
acquaint
thee
with
my
story
know
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
further
parts
of
india
the
lord
of
the
ebony
island
my
father
had
married
me
to
the
son
of
my
uncle
but
on
the
night
of
my
bridal
festivities
an
efreet
namad
jarjarees
the
son
of
rejmoos
the
son
of
iblees
carried
me
off
and
soaring
with
me
through
the
air
alighted
in
this
place
to
which
he
conveyed
all
things
necessary
for
me
such
as
ornaments
and
garments
and
linen
and
furniture
and
food
and
drink
and
once
in
every
ten
days
he
cometh
to
me
and
spendeth
a
night
here52
and
he
hath
appointed
with
me
that
in
case
of
my
wanting
any
thing
by144
night
or
day
i
should
touch
with
my
hand
these
two
lines
which
are
inscribed
upon
the
áubbeh53
and
as
soon
as
i
remove
my
hand
i
see
him
before
me
four
days
have
now
passed
since
he
was
last
with
me
and
there
remain
therefore
six
days
before
he
will
come
again
wilt
thou
then
remain
with
me
five
days
and
depart
one
day
before
his
visitâi
answered
yes
rejoicing
at
the
proposal
and
she
arose
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
conducted
me
through
an
arched
door
to
a
small
and
elegant
bath
where
i
took
off
my
clothes
while
she
seated
herself
upon
a
mattress
after
this
she
seated
me
by
her
side
and
brought
me
some
sherbet
of
sugar
infused
with
musk54
and
handed
it
to
me
to
drink
she
then
placed
some
food
before
me
and
after
we
had
eaten
and
conversed
together
she
said
to
me
sleep
and
rest
thyself
for
thou
art
fatigued

i
slept
o
my
mistress
and
forgot
all
that
had
befallen
me
and
when
i
awoke
i
found
her
rubbing
my
feet55
upon
which
i
called
to
her
and
we
sat
down
again
and
conversed
a
while
and
she
said
to
me
by
allah
i
was
straitened
in
my
heart
living
here
alone
without
any
person
to
talk
with
me
five
and
twenty
years
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
sent
thee
to
meâi
thanked
her
for
her
kind
expressions
and
love
of
her
took
possession
of
my
heart
and
my
anxiety
and
grief
fled
away
we
then
sat
down
to
drink
together
and
i
remained
by
her
side
all
the
night
delighted
with
her
company
for
i
had
never
seen
her
like
in
my
whole
life
and
in
the
morning
when
we
were
both
full
of
joy
i
said
to
her
shall
i
take
thee
up
from
this
subterranean
place
and
release
thee
from
the
jinnee
but
she
laughed
and
replied
be
content
and
hold
thy
peace
for
of
every
ten
days
one
day
shall
be
for
the
efreet
and
nine
for
thee
i
persisted
however
being
overcome
with
passion
and
said
i
will
this
instant
demolish
this
áubbeh
upon
which
the
inscription
is
engraved
and
let
the
efreet
come
that
i
may
slay
him
for
i
am
predestined
to
kill
efreets
she
entreated
me
to
refrain
but
paying
no
attention
to
her
words
i
kicked
the
áubbeh
with
violence
upon
which
she
exclaimed
the
efreet
hath
arrived
did
i
not
caution
thee
against
this
verily
thou
hast
brought
a
calamity
upon
me
but
save
thyself
and
ascend
by
the
way
that
thou
camest

in
the
excess
of
my
fear
i
forgot
my
sandals
and
my
axe
and
when
i
had
ascended
two
steps
turning
round
to
look
for
them
i
saw
that
the
ground
had
opened
and
there
rose
from
it
an
efreet
of
hideous
aspect
who
said
wherefore
is
this
disturbance
with
which
thou
hast
alarmed
me
and
what
misfortune
hath
befallen
thee
she145
answered
no
misfortune
hath
happened
to
me
excepting
that
my
heart
was
contracted
and
i
desired
to
drink
some
wine
to
dilate
it
and
rising
to
perform
my
purpose
i
fell
against
the
áubbehâthou
liest
vile
woman
he
exclaimedâand
looking
about
the
palace
to
the
right
and
left
he
saw
the
sandals
and
axe
and
said
to
her
these
are
the
property
of
none
but
a
man
who
hath
visited
theeâi
have
not
seen
them
she
answered
until
this
instant
probably
they
caught
to
theeâthis
language
said
he
is
absurd
and
will
have
no
effect
upon
me
thou
shameless
womanâand
so
saying
he
stripped
her
of
her
clothing
and
tied
her
down
with
her
arms
and
legs
extended
to
four
stakes
and
began
to
beat
her
urging
her
to
confess
what
had
happened

second
prince
ascending
the
steps
for
myself
being
unable
to
endure
her
cries
i
ascended
the
stairs
overpowered
by
fear
and
arriving
at
the
top
replaced
the
trap-door
as
it
was
at
first
and
covered
it
over
with
earth
i
repented
bitterly
of
what
i
had
done
and
reflecting
upon
the
lady
and
her
beauty
and
how
this
wretch
was
torturing
her
after
she
had
lived
with
him
five
and
twenty
years
and
that
he
tortured
her
only
on
my
account
and
reflecting
also
upon
my
father
and
his
kingdom
and
how
i
had
been
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
wood-cutter
i
repeated
this
verseâ

when
fortune
bringeth
thee
affliction
console
thyself
by
remembering
that
one
day
thou
must
see
prosperity
and
another
day
difficulty
second
prince
carried
off
by
the
efreet
returning
to
my
companion
the
tailor
i
found
him
awaiting
my
return
as
if
he
were
placed
in
a
pan
upon
burning
coals
i
past
last146
night
said
he
with
anxious
heart
on
thy
account
fearing
for
thee
from
some
wild
beast
or
other
calamity
praise
be
to
god
for
thy
safe
returnâi
thanked
him
for
his
tender
concern
for
me
and
entered
my
apartment
and
as
i
sat
meditating
upon
that
which
had
befallen
me
and
blaming
myself
for
having
kicked
the
áubbeh
my
friend
the
tailor
came
in
to
me
and
said
in
the
shop
is
a
foreigner
who
asks
for
thee
and
he
has
thy
axe
and
sandals
he
came
with
them
to
the
wood-cutters56
and
said
to
them
i
went
out
at
the
time
of
the
call
of
the
muÃddin
to
morning-prayer
and
stumbled
upon
these
and
know
not
to
whom
they
belong
can
ye
guide
me
to
their
ownerâthe
wood-cutters
therefore
directed
him
to
thee
he
is
sitting
in
my
shop
so
go
out
to
him
and
thank
him
and
take
thy
axe
and
thy
sandalsâon
hearing
these
words
my
countenance
turned
pale
and
my
whole
state
became
changed
and
while
i
was
in
this
condition
the
floor
of
my
chamber
clove
asunder
and
there
rose
from
it
the
stranger
and
lo
he
was
the
efreet
he
had
tortured
the
lady
with147
the
utmost
cruelty
but
she
would
confess
nothing
so
he
took
the
axe
and
the
sandals
and
said
to
her
if
i
am
jarjarees
of
the
descendants
of
iblees
i
will
bring
the
owner
of
this
axe
and
these
sandals
accordingly
he
came
with
the
pretence
before
mentioned
to
the
wood-cutters
and
having
entered
my
chamber
without
granting
me
any
delay
seized
me
and
soared
with
me
through
the
air
he
then
descended
and
dived
into
the
earth
and
brought
me
up
into
the
palace
where
i
was
before

here
i
beheld
the
lady
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
with
blood
flowing
from
her
sides
and
tears
trickled
from
my
eyes
the
efreet
then
took
hold
of
her
and
said
vile
woman
this
is
thy
loverâwhereupon
she
looked
at
me
and
replied
i
know
him
not
nor
have
i
ever
seen
him
until
this
instant
the
efreet
said
to
her
with
all
this
torture
wilt
thou
not
confess
she
answered
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
him
before
and
it
is
not
lawful
in
the
sight
of
god
that
i
should
speak
falsely
against
him57âthen
said
he
if
thou
know
him
not
take
this
sword
and
strike
off
his
head
she
took
the
sword
and
came
to
me
and
stood
over
my
head
but
i
made
a
sign
to
her
with
my
eyebrow
while
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
she
replied
in
a
similar
manner
thou
art
he
who
hath
done
all
this
to
meâi
made
a
sign
to
her
however
that
this
was
a
time
for
pardon
conveying
my
meaning
in
the
manner
thus
described
by
the
poetâ58

our
signal
in
love
is
the
glance
of
our
eyes
and
every
intelligent
person
understandeth
the
sign
our
eyebrows
carry
on
an
intercourse
between
us
we
are
silent
but
love
speaketh
and
when
she
understood
me
she
threw
the
sword
from
her
hand
o
my
mistress
and
the
efreet
handed
it
to
me
saying
strike
off
her
head
and
i
will
liberate
thee
and
do
thee
no
harm
i
replied
goodâand
quickly
approaching
her
raised
my
hand
but
she
made
a
sign
as
though
she
would
say
i
did
no
injury
to
theeâwhereupon
my
eyes
poured
with
tears
and
throwing
down
the
sword
i
said
o
mighty
efreet
and
valiant
hero
if
a
woman
deficient
in
sense
and
religion59
seeth
it
not
lawful
to
strike
off
my
head
how
is
it
lawful
for
me
to
do
so
to
her
and
especially
when
i
have
never
seen
her
before
in
my
life
i
will
never
do
it
though
i
should
drink
the
cup
of
death
and
destructionâthere
is
affection
between
you
said
the
efreet
and
taking
the
sword
he
struck
off
one
of
the
hands
of
the
lady
then
the
other
after
this
her
right
foot
and
then
her
left
foot
thus
with
four
blows
he
cut
off
her
four
extremities
while
i148
looked
on
expecting
my
own
death
she
then
made
a
sign
to
me
with
her
eye
and
the
efreet
observing
her
exclaimed
now
thou
hast
been
guilty
of
incontinence
with
thine
eyeâand
with
a
blow
of
his
sword
struck
off
her
head
after
which
he
turned
towards
me
and
said
o
man
it
is
allowed
us
by
our
law
if
a
wife
be
guilty
of
incontinence
to
put
her
to
death
this
woman
i
carried
off
on
her
wedding-night
when
she
was
twelve
years
of
age
and
she
was
acquainted
with
no
man
but
me
and
i
used
to
pass
one
night
with
her
in
the
course
of
every
ten
days
in
the
garb
of
a
foreigner
and
when
i
discovered
of
a
certainty
that
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
me
i
killed
her
but
as
for
thee
i
am
not
convinced
that
thou
hast
wronged
me
with
respect
to
her
yet
i
must
not
leave
thee
unpunished
choose
therefore
what
injury
i
shall
do
to
thee

second
prince
begging
his
life
of
the
efreet
upon
this
o
my
mistress
i
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
eager
to
obtain
his
pardon
i
said
to
him
what
shall
i
choose
from
thy
handsâchoose
he
answered
into
what
form
i
shall
change
thee
either
the
form
of
a
dog
or
that
of
an
ass
or
that
of
an
ape
i
replied
in
my
desire
of
forgiveness
verily
if
thou
wilt
pardon
me
god
will
pardon
thee
in
recompense
for
thy
shewing
mercy
to
a
muslim
who
hath
done
thee
no
injuryâand
i
humbled
myself
in
the
most
abject
manner
and
said
to
him
pardon
me
as
the
envied

the
envierâand
how

the
story
of
the
envier
and
the
envied

know
o
my
master
that
there
was
a
certain
man
who
had
a
neighbour
that
envied
him
and
the
more
this
person
envied
him
so
much
the
more
did
god
increase
the
prosperity
of
the
former
thus
it
continued
a
long
time
but
when
the
envied
man
found
that
his
neighbour
persisted
in
troubling
him
he
removed
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
deserted
well
and
there
he
built
for
himself
an
oratory
and
occupied
himself
in
the
worship
of
god
numerous
faáeers61
assembled
around
him
and
he
acquired
great
esteem
people
repairing
to
him
from
every
quarter
placing
firm
reliance
upon
his
sanctity
and
his
fame
reached
the
ears
of
his
envious
neighbour
who
mounted
his
horse
and
went
to
visit
him
and
when
the
envied
man
saw
him
he
saluted
him
and
payed
him
the
utmost
civility
the
envier
then
said
to
him
i
have
come
hither
to
inform
thee
of
a
matter
in
which
thou
wilt
find
advantage
and
for
which
i
shall
obtain
a
recompense
in
heaven
the
envied
man
replied
may
god
requite
thee
for
me
with
every
blessing
then
said
the
envier
order
the
faáeers
to
retire
to
their
cells
for
the
information
that
i
am
about
to
give
thee
i
would
have
no
one
overhear
so
he
ordered
them
to
enter
their
cells
and
the
envier
said
to
him
arise
and
let
us
walk
together
and
converse
and
they
walked
on
until
they
came
to
the
deserted
well
before
mentioned
when
the
envier
pushed
the
envied
man
into
this
well
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
and
went
his
way
imagining
that
he
had
killed
him

but
this
well
was
inhabited
by
jinn
who
received
him
unhurt
and
seated
him
upon
a
large
stone
and
when
they
had
done
this
one
of
them
said
to
the
others
do
ye
know
this
man
they
answered
we
know
him
notâthis
said
he
is
the
envied
man
who
fled
from
him
who
envied
him
and
took
up
his
abode
in
this
quarter
in
the
neighbouring
oratory
and
who
entertaineth
us
by
his
zikr62
and
his
readings
and
when
his
envier
heard
of
him
he
came
hither
to
him
and
devising
a
stratagem
against
him
threw
him
down
here
his
fame
hath
this
night
reached
the
suláÃn
of
this
city
who
hath
purposed
to
visit
him
to-morrow
on
account
of
the
affliction
which
hath
befallen
his
daughterâand
what
said
they
hath
happened
to
his
daughter
he
answered
madness
for
meymoon
the
son
of
demdem
hath
become
inflamed
with
love
for
her
and
her
cure
is
the
easiest
of
things
they
asked
him
what
is
itâand
he
answered150
the
black
cat
that
is
with
him
in
the
oratory
hath
at
the
end
of
her
tail
a
white
spot
of
the
size
of
a
piece
of
silver
and
from
this
white
spot
should
be
taken
seven
hairs
and
with
these
the
damsel
should
be
fumigated
and
the
mÃrid
would
depart
from
over
her
head
and
not
return
to
her
so
she
would
be
instantly
cured
and
now
it
is
our
duty
to
take
him
out

the
envied
sheykh
and
the
jinn
in
the
well
when
the
morning
came
the
faáeers
saw
the
sheykh
rising
out
of
the
well
and
he
became
magnified
in
their
eyes
and
when
he
entered
the
oratory
he
took
from
the
white
spot
at
the
end
of
the
cats
tail
seven
hairs
and
placed
them
in
a
portfolio
by
him
and
at
sunrise
the
king
came
to
him
and
when
the
sheykh
saw
him
he
said
to
him
o
king
thou
hast
come
to
visit
me
in
order
that
i
may
cure
thy
daughter
the
king
replied
yes
o
virtuous
sheykhâthen
said
the
sheykh
send
some
person
to
bring
her
hither
and
i
trust
in
god
whose
name
be
exalted
that
she
may
be
instantly
cured
and
when
the
king
had
brought
his
daughter
the
sheykh
beheld
her
bound
and
seating
her
suspended
a
curtain
over
her
and
took
out
the
hairs
and
fumigated
her
with
them
whereupon
the
mÃrid
cried151
out
from
over
her
head
and
left
her
and
the
damsel
immediately
recovered
her
reason
and
veiling
her
face
said
to
her
father
what
is
this
and
wherefore
didst
thou
bring
me
to
this
place
he
answered
her
thou
hast
nothing
to
fearâand
rejoiced
greatly
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
envied
sheykh
and
said
to
the
great
men
of
his
court
who
were
with
him
what
shall
be
the
recompense
of
this
sheykh
for
that
which
he
hath
done
they
answered
his
recompense
should
be
that
thou
marry
him
to
herâye
have
spoken
truly
said
the
kingâand
he
gave
her
in
marriage
to
him
and
thus
the
sheykh
became
a
connection
of
the
king
and
after
some
days
the
king
died
and
he
was
made
king
in
his
place

and
it
happened
one
day
that
this
envied
king
was
riding
with
his
troops
and
he
saw
his
envier
approaching
and
when
this
man
came
before
him
he
seated
him
upon
a
horse
with
high
distinction
and
honour
and
taking
him
to
his
palace
gave
him
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
a
costly
dress
after
which
he
sent
him
back
from
the
city
with
attendants
to
escort
him
to
his
house
and
reproached
him
for
nothingâconsider
then
o
efreet
the
pardon
of
the
envied
to
the
envier
and
his
kindness
to
him
notwithstanding
the
injuries
he
had
done
him63

when
he
had

replied
lengthen
not
thy
words
to
me
as
to
my
killing
thee

it
not

as
to
my
pardoning
thee
covet
it
not

as
to
my
enchanting
thee
there
is
no

from
itâand
so
saying
he
clove
the
earth
asunder
and
soared
with
me
through
the
sky
to
such
a
height
that
i
beheld
the
world
beneath
me
as
though
it
were
a
bowl
of
water
then
alighting
upon
a
mountain
he
took
up
a
little
dust
and
having
muttered
and
pronounced
certain
words
over
it
sprinkled
me
with
it
saying
quit
this
form
and
take
the
form
of
an
apeâwhereupon
i
became
like
an
ape
of
a
hundred
years
of
age

into

form
i
wept
for
myself
but
determined
to
be
patient
under
the
tyranny
of
fortune
knowing
it
to
be
constant
to
no
one
i
descended
from
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
after
having
journeyed
for
the
space
of
a
month
arrived
at
the
sea-shore
and
when
i
had
stood
there
a
short
time
i
saw
a
vessel
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
with
a
favourable
wind
approaching152
the
land
i
therefore
hid
myself
behind
a
rock
on
the
beach
and
when
the
ship
came
close
up
i
sprang
into
the
midst
of
it
but
as
soon
as
the
persons
on
board
saw
me
one
of
them
cried
turn
out
this
unlucky
brute
from
the
shipâanother
said
let
us
kill
himâand
a
third
exclaimed
i
will
kill
him
with
this
sword
i
however
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
sword
and
tears
flowed
from
my
eyes
at
the
sight
of
which
the
captain
took
compassion
on
me
and
said
to
the
passengers
o
merchants
this
ape
hath
sought
my
aid
and
i
give
it
him
he
is
under
my
protection
let
no
one
therefore
oppose
or
trouble
him
he
then
treated
me
with
kindness
and
whatever
he
said
to
me
i
understood
and
all
that
he
required
to
be
done
i
performed
as
his
servant153

we
continued
our
voyage
for
fifty
days
with
a
fair
wind
and
cast
anchor
under
a
large
city
containing
a
population
which
no
one
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
could
reckon
and
when
we
had
moored
our
vessel
there
came
to
us
some
memlooks
from
the
king
of
the
city
who
came
on
board
the
ship
and
complimented
the
merchants
on
their
safe
arrival
saying
our
king
greeteth
you
rejoicing
in
your
safety
and
hath
sent
to
you
this
roll
of
paper
desiring
that
each
of
you
shall
write
a
line
upon
it
for
the
king
had
a
wezeer
who
was
an
eminent
caligraphist
and
he
is
dead
and
the
king
hath
sworn
that
he
will
not
appoint
any
person
to
his
office
who
cannot
write
equally
well64
though
in
the
form
of
an
ape
i
arose
and
snatched
the
paper
from
their
hands
upon
which
fearing
that
i
would
tear
it
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
they
cried
out
against
me
and
would
have
killed
me
but
i
made
signs
to
them
that
i
would
write
and
the
captain
said
to
them
suffer
him
to
write
and
if
he
scribble
we
will
turn
him
away
but
if
he
write
well
i
will
adopt
him
as
my
son
for
i
have
never
seen
a
more
intelligent
ape
so
i
took
the
pen
and
demanded
the
ink
and
wrote
in
an
epistolary
hand
this
coupletâ

fame
hath
recorded
the
virtues
of
the
noble
but
no
one
hath
been
able
to
reckon
thine
may
god
not
deprive
mankind
of
such
a
father
for
thou
art
the
parent
of
every
excellence
then
in
a
more
formal
large
hand
i
wrote
the
following
versesâ

there
is
no
writer
that
shall
not
perish
but
what
his
hand
hath
written
endureth
ever
write
therefore
nothing
but
what
will
please
thee
when
thou
shalt
see
it
on
the
day
of
resurrection
two
other
specimens
i
wrote
in
two
different
and
smaller
hands
and
returned
the
paper
to
the
memlooks
who
took
it
back
to
the
king
and
when
he
saw
what
was
written
upon
it
the
hand
of
no
one
pleased
him
excepting
mine
and
he
said
to
his
attendants
go
to
the
author
of
this
hand-writing
put
upon
him
this
dress
and
mount
him
upon
a
mule
and
conduct
him
with
the
band
of
music
before
him
to
my
presence
on
hearing
this
order
they
smiled
and
the
king
was
angry
with
them
and
said
how
is
it
that
i
give
you
an
order
and
ye
laugh
at
me
they
answered
o
king
we
laugh
not
at
thy
words
but
because
he
who
wrote
this
is
an
ape
and
not
a
son
of
adam
he
is
with
the
captain
of
the
ship
newly
arrived

the
king
was
astonished
at
their
words
he
shook
with
delight
and
said
i
would
purchase
this
ape
he
then
sent
some
messengers154
to
the
ship
with
the
mule
and
the
dress
of
honour
saying
to
them
ye
must
clothe
him
with
this
dress
and
mount
him
upon
the
mule
and
bring
him
hither
so
they
came
to
the
ship
and
taking
me
from
the
captain
clad
me
with
the
dress
and
the
people
were
astonished
and
flocked
to
amuse
themselves
with
the
sight
of
me
and
when
they
brought
me
to
the
king
and
i
beheld
him
i
kissed
the
ground
before
him
three
times
and
he
ordered
me
to
sit
down
so
i
sat
down
upon
my
knees65
and
the
persons
present
were
surprised
at
my
polite
manners
and
especially
the
king
who
presently
ordered
his
people
to
retire
they
therefore
did
so
none
remaining
but
the
king
and
a
eunuch
and
a
young
memlook
and
myself
the
king
then
commanded
that
a
repast
should
be
brought
and
they
placed
before
him
a
service
of
viands
such
as
gratified
the
appetite
and
delighted
the
eye
and
the
king
made
a
sign
to
me
that
i
should
eat
whereupon
i
arose
and
having
kissed
the
ground
before
him
seven
times
sat
down
to
eat
with
him
and
when
the
table
was
removed
i
washed
my
hands
and
taking
the
ink-case
and
pen
and
paper
i
wrote
these
two
versesâ

great
is
my
appetite
for
thee
o
kunÃfeh66
i
cannot
be
happy
nor
endure
without
thee
be
thou
every
day
and
night
my
food
and
may
drops
of
honey
not
be
wanting
to
moisten
thee
having
done
this
i
arose
and
seated
myself
at
a
distance
and
the
king
looking
at
what
i
had
written
read
it
with
astonishment
and
exclaimed
can
an
ape
possess
such
fluency
and
such
skill
in
caligraphy
this
is
indeed
a
wonder
of
wondersâafterwards
a
chess-table
was
brought
to
the
king
and
he
said
to
me
wilt
thou
play
by
a
motion
of
my
head
i
answered
yesâand
i
advanced
and
arranged
the
pieces67
i
played
with
him
twice
and
beat
him
and
the
king
was
perplexed
and
said
were
this
a
man
he
would
surpass
all
the
people
of
his
age

he
then
said
to
his
eunuch
go
to
thy
mistress
and
say
to
her
answer
the
summons
of
the
kingâthat
she
may
come
and
gratify
her
curiosity
by
the
sight
of
this
wonderful
ape
the
eunuch
therefore
went
and
returned
with
his
mistress
the
kings
daughter
who
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
veiled
her
face
and
said
o
my
father
how
is
it
that
thou
art
pleased
to
send
for
me
and
suffer
strange
men
to
see
meâo
my
daughter
answered
the
king
there
is
no
one
here
but
the
young
memlook
and
the
eunuch
who
brought
thee
up
and
this
ape
with
myself
thy
father
from
whom
then
dost
thou
veil
thy155
faceâthis
ape
said
she
is
the
son
of
a
king
and
the
name
of
his
father
is
eymÃr68
he
is
enchanted
and
it
was
the
efreet
jarjarees
a
descendant
of
iblees
who
transformed
him
after
having
slain
his
own
wife
the
daughter
of
king
aánÃmoos
this
whom
thou
supposedst
to
be
an
ape
is
a
learned
and
wise
manâthe
king
was
amazed
at
his
daughters
words
and
looking
towards
me
said
is
it
true
that
she
saith
of
thee
i
answered
by
a
motion
of
my
head
yesâand
wept
the
king
then
said
to
his
daughter
by
what
means
didst
thou
discover
that
he
was
enchantedâo
my
father
she
answered
i
had
with
me
in
my
younger
years
an
old
woman
who
was
a
cunning
enchantress
and
she
taught
me
the
art
of
enchantment
i
have
committed
its
rules
to
memory
and
know
it
thoroughly
being
acquainted
with
a
hundred
and
seventy
modes
of
performing
it
by
the
least
of
which
i
could
transport
the
stones
of
thy
city
beyond
mount
áÃf
and
make
its
site
to
be
an
abyss
of
the
sea
and
convert
its
inhabitants
into
fish
in
the
midst
of
itâi
conjure
thee
then
by
the
name
of
allah
said
her
father
to
restore
this
young
man
that
i
may
make
him
my
wezeer
is
it
possible
that
thou
possessedst
this
excellence
and
i
knew
it
not
restore
him
that
i
may
make
him
my
wezeer
for
he
is
a
polite
and
intelligent
youth

the
ape
recognised
by
the
princess
she
replied
with
pleasureâand
taking
a
knife
upon
which
were
engraved
some
hebrew
names
marked
with
it
a
circle
in
the
midst
of
the
palace
within
this
she
wrote
certain
names
and
talismans
and
then
she
pronounced
invocations
and
uttered
unintelligible
words
and
soon
the
palace
around
us
became
immersed
in
gloom
to
156
the
combat
with
the
lion
head-piece
transformations
such
a
degree
that
we
thought
the
whole
world
was
overspread
and
lo
the
efreet
appeared
before
us
in
a
most
hideous
shape
with
hands
like
winnowing-forks
and
legs
like
masts
and
eyes
like
burning
torches
so
that
we
were
terrified
at
him
the
kings
daughter
exclaimed
no
welcome
to
theeâto
which
the
efreet
assuming
the
form
of
a
lion
replied
thou
traitress
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
broken
thine
oath
did
we
not
swear
that
we
would
not
oppose
one
anotherâthou
wretch
said
she
when
didst
thou
receive
an
oathâthe
efreet
still
in
the
form
of
a
lion
then
exclaimed
take
what
awaiteth
theeâand
opening
his
mouth
rushed
upon
the
lady
but
she
instantly
plucked
a
hair
from
her
head
and
muttered
with
her
lips
whereupon
the
hair
became
converted
into
a
piercing
sword
with
which
she
struck
the
lion
and
he
was
cleft
in
twain
by
the
blow
but
his
head
became
changed
into
a
scorpion
the
lady
immediately
transformed
herself
into
an
enormous
serpent
and
crept
after
the
execrable
wretch
in
the
shape
of
a
scorpion
and
a
sharp
contest
ensued
between
them
after
which
the
scorpion
became
an
eagle
and
the
serpent
changing
to
a
vulture
pursued
the
eagle
for
a
length
of
time
the
latter
then
transformed
himself
into
a
black
cat
and
the
kings
daughter
became
a
wolf
and
they
fought
together
long
and
fiercely
till
the
cat
seeing
himself
overcome
changed
himself157

transformations
into
a
large
red
pomegranate
which
fell
into
a
pool
but
the
wolf
pursuing
it
it
ascended
into
the
air
and
then
fell
upon
the
pavement
of
the
palace
and
broke
in
pieces
its
grains
becoming
scattered
each
apart
from
the
others
and
all
spread
about
the
whole
space
of
ground
enclosed
by
the
palace
the
wolf
upon
this
transformed
itself
into
a
cock
in
order
to
pick
up
the
grains
and
not
leave
one
of
them
but
according
to
the
decree
of
fate
one
grain
remained
hidden
by
the
side
of
the
pool
of
the
fountain
the
cock
began
to
cry
and
flapped
its
wings
and
made
a
sign
to
us
with
its
beak
but
we
understood
not
what
it
would
say
it
then
uttered
at
us
such
a
cry
that
we
thought
the
palace
had
fallen
down
upon
us
and
it
ran
about
the
whole
of
the
ground
until
it
saw
the
grain
that
had
lain
hid
by
the
side
of
the
pool
when
it
pounced
upon
it
to
pick
it
up
but
it
fell
into
the
midst
of
the
water
and
became
transformed
into
a
fish
and
sank
into
the
water
upon
which
the
cock
became
a
fish
of
a
larger
size
and
plunged
in
after
the
other
for
a
while
it
was
absent
from
our
sight
but
at
length
we
heard
a
loud
cry
and
trembled
at
the
sound
after
which
the
efreet
rose
as
a
flame
of
fire
casting
fire
from
his
mouth
and
fire
and
smoke
from
his
eyes
and
nostrils
the
kings
daughter
also
became
as
a
vast
body
of
fire
and
we
would
have
plunged
into
the
water
from
fear
of
our
being
burnt
and
destroyed
but
suddenly
the
efreet
cried
out
from
within
the
fire
and
came
towards
us
upon
the
leewÃn69
blowing
fire
at
our
faces
the
lady
however
overtook
him
and
blew
fire
in
like
manner
in
his
face
and
some
sparks
struck
us
both
from
her
and
from
him
her
sparks
did
us
no
harm
but
one
from
him
struck
me
in
my
eye
and
destroyed
it
i
being
still
in
the158
form
of
an
ape
and
a
spark
from
him
reached
the
face
of
the
king
and
burned
the
lower
half
with
his
beard
and
mouth
and
struck
out
his
lower
teeth
another
spark
also
fell
upon
the
breast
of
the
eunuch
who
was
burnt
and
died
immediately
we
expected
destruction
and
gave
up
all
hope
of
preserving
our
lives
but
while
we
were
in
this
state
a
voice
exclaimed
god
is
most
great
god
is
most
great
he
hath
conquered
and
aided
and
abandoned
the
denier
of
the
faith
of
moáammad
the
chief
of
mankind70âthe
person
from
whom
this
voice
proceeded
was
the
kings
daughter
she
had
burnt
the
efreet
and
when
we
looked
towards
him
we
perceived
that
he
had
become
a
heap
of
ashes

disenchantment
of
the
ape
the
lady
then
came
to
us
and
said
bring
me
a
cup
of
waterâand
when
it
was
brought
to
her
she
pronounced
over
it
some
words
which
we
understood
not
and
sprinkling
me
with
it
said
be
restored159
by
virtue
of
the
name
of
the
truth
and
by
virtue
of
the
most
great
name
of
god
to
thy
original
formâwhereupon
i
became
a
man
as
i
was
at
first
excepting
that
my
eye
was
destroyed
after
this
she
cried
out
the
fire
the
fire
o
my
father
i
shall
no
longer
live
for
i
am
predestined
to
be
killed
had
he
been
a
human
being
i
had
killed
him
at
the
first
of
the
encounter
i
experienced
no
difficulty
till
the
scattering
of
the
grains
of
the
pomegranate
when
i
picked
them
up
excepting
the
one
in
which
was
the
life
of
the
jinnee
had
i
picked
up
that
he
had
instantly
died
but
i
saw
it
not
as
fate
and
destiny
had
appointed
and
suddenly
he
came
upon
me
and
a
fierce
contest
ensued
between
us
under
the
earth
and
in
the
air
and
in
the
water
and
every
time
that
he
tried
against
me
a
new
mode
i
employed
against
him
one
more
potent
until
he
tried
against
me
the
mode
of
fire
and
rarely
does
one
escape
against
whom
the
mode
of
fire
is
employed
destiny
however
aided
me
so
that
i
burned
him
first
but
i
exhorted
him
previously
to
embrace
the
faith
of
el-islÃm
now
i
die
and
may
god
supply
my
place
to
youâhaving
thus
said
she
ceased
not
to
pray
for
relief
from
the
fire
and
lo
a
spark
ascended
to
her
breast
and
thence
to
her
face
and
when
it
reached
her
face
she
wept
and
exclaimed
i
testify
that
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
i
testify
that
moáammad
is
gods
apostleâwe
then
looked
towards
her
and
saw
that
she
had
become
a
heap
of
ashes
by
the
side
of
the
ashes
of
the
efreet

we
were
plunged
into
grief
on
her
account
and
i
wished
that
i
had
been
in
her
place
rather
than
have
seen
that
sweet-faced
creature
who
had
done
me
this
kindness
reduced
to
a
heap
of
ashes
but
the
decree
of
god
cannot
be
averted
the
king
on
beholding
his
daughter
in
this
state
plucked
out
what
remained
of
his
beard
and
slapped
his
face
and
rent
his
clothes
and
i
also
did
the
same
while
we
both
wept
for
her
then
came
the
chamberlains
and
other
great
officers
of
the
court
who
finding
the
king
in
a
state
of
insensibility
with
two
heaps
of
ashes
before
him
were
astonished
and
remained
encompassing
him
until
he
recovered
from
his
fit
when
he
informed
them
of
what
had
befallen
his
daughter
with
the
efreet
and
great
was
their
affliction
the
women
shrieked
with
the
female
slaves
and
continued
their
mourning
seven
days
after
this
the
king
gave
orders
to
build
over
the
ashes
of
his
daughter
a
great
tomb
with
a
dome
and
illuminated
it
with
candles
and
lamps
but
the
ashes
of
the
efreet
they
scattered
in
the
wind
exposing
them
to
the
curse
of
god
the
king
then
fell
sick
and
was
near
unto
death
his
illness
lasted
a
month160
but
after
this
he
recovered
his
health
and
summoning
me
to
his
presence
said
to
me
o
young
man
we
passed
our
days
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
utmost
happiness
secure
from
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
until
thou
camest
to
us
when
troubles
overcame
us
would
that
we
had
never
seen
thee
nor
thy
ugly
form
on
account
of
which
we
have
been
reduced
to
this
state
of
privation
for
in
the
first
place
i
have
lost
my
daughter
who
was
worth
a
hundred
men
and
secondly
i
have
suffered
this
burning
and
lost
my
teeth
my
eunuch
also
is
dead
but
it
was
not
in
thy
power
to
prevent
these
afflictions
the
decree
of
god
hath
been
fulfilled
on
us
and
on
thee
and
praise
be
to
god
that
my
daughter
restored
thee
though
she
destroyed
herself
now
however
depart
o
my
son
from
my
city
it
is
enough
that
hath
happened
on
thy
account
but
as
it
was
decreed
against
us
and
thee
depart
in
peace

so
i
departed
o
my
mistress
from
his
presence
but
before
i
quitted
the
city
i
entered
a
public
bath
and
shaved
my
beard
i
traversed
various
regions
and
passed
through
great
cities
and
bent
my
course
to
the
abode
of
peace71
baghdÃd
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
an
interview
with
the
prince
of
the
faithful
that
i
might
relate
to
him
all
that
had
befallen
me

the
third
mendicant
then
advanced
and
thus
related
his
storyâ

the
story
of
the
third
royal
mendicant

o
illustrious
lady
my
story
is
not
like
those
of
my
two
companions
but
more
wonderful
the
course
of
fate
and
destiny
brought
upon
them
events
against
which
they
could
not
guard
but
as
to
myself
the
shaving
of
my
beard
and
the
loss
of
my
eye
were
occasioned
by
my
provoking
fate
and
misfortune
and
the
cause
was
thisâ

i
was
a
king
and
the
son
of
a
king
and
when
my
father
died
i
succeeded
to
his
throne
and
governed
my
subjects
with
justice
and
beneficence
i
took
pleasure
in
sea-voyages
and
my
capital
was
on
the
shore
of
an
extensive
sea
interspersed
with
fortified
and
garrisoned
islands
which
i
desired
for
my
amusement
to
visit
i
therefore
embarked
with
a
fleet
of
ten
ships
and
took
with
me
provisions
sufficient
for
a
whole
month
i
proceeded
twenty
days
after
which
there
arose
against
us
a
contrary
wind
but
at
daybreak
it
ceased
and
the
sea
became
calm
and
we
arrived
at
an
island
where
we
landed
and
cooked
some
provisions
and
ate
after
which
we
remained
there161
two
days
we
then
continued
our
voyage
and
when
twenty
days
more
had
passed
we
found
ourselves
in
strange
waters
unknown
to
the
captain
and
desired
the
watch
to
look
out
from
the
mast-head
so
he
went
aloft
and
when
he
had
come
down
he
said
to
the
captain
i
saw
on
my
right
hand
fish
floating
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
and
looking
towards
the
midst
of
the
sea
i
perceived
something
looming
in
the
distance
sometimes
black
and
sometimes
white

when
the
captain
heard
this
report
of
the
watch
he
threw
his
turban
on
the
deck
and
plucked
his
beard
and
said
to
those
who
were
with
him
receive
warning
of
our
destruction
which
will
befall
all
of
us
not
one
will
escape
so
saying
he
began
to
weep
and
all
of
us
in
like
manner
bewailed
our
lot
i
desired
him
to
inform
us
of
that
which
the
watch
had
seen
o
my
lord
he
replied
know
that
we
have
wandered
from
our
course
since
the
commencement
of
the
contrary
wind
that
was
followed
in
the
morning
by
a
calm
in
consequence
of
which
we
remained
stationary
two
days
from
that
period
we
have
deviated
from
our
course
for
twenty-one
days
and
we
have
no
wind
to
carry
us
back
from
the
fate
which
awaits
us
after
this
day
to-morrow
we
shall
arrive
at
a
mountain
of
black
stone
called
loadstone
the
current
is
now
bearing
us
violently
towards
it
and
the
ships
will
fall
in
pieces
and
every
nail
in
them
will
fly
to
the
mountain
and
adhere
to
it
for
god
hath
given
to
the
loadstone
a
secret
property
by
virtue
of
which
everything
of
iron
is
attracted
towards
it
on
that
mountain
is
such
a
quantity
of
iron
as
no
one
knoweth
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
for
from
times
of
old
great
numbers
of
ships
have
been
destroyed
by
the
influence
of
that
mountain72
there
is
upon
the
summit
of
the
mountain
a
cupola
of
brass
supported
by
ten
columns
and
upon
the
top
of
this
cupola
is
a
horseman
upon
a
horse
of
brass
having
in
his
hand
a
brazen
spear
and
upon
his
breast
suspended
a
tablet
of
lead
upon
which
are
engraved
mysterious
names
and
talismans
and
as
long
o
king
as
this
horseman
remains
upon
the
horse
so
long
will
every
ship
that
approaches
be
destroyed
with
every
person
on
board
and
all
the
iron
contained
in
it
will
cleave
to
the
mountain
no
one
will
be
safe
until
the
horseman
shall
have
fallen
from
the
horseâthe
captain
then
wept
bitterly
and
we
felt
assured
that
our
destruction
was
inevitable
and
every
one
of
us
bade
adieu
to
his
friend

the
mountain
of
loadstone
on
the
following
morning
we
drew
near
to
the
mountain
the
current
carried
us
towards
it
with
violence
and
when
the
ships
were
almost
close
to
it
they
fell
asunder
and
all
the
nails
and
every
thing162
else
that
was
of
iron
flew
from
them
towards
the
loadstone
it
was
near
the
close
of
day
when
the
ships
fell
in
pieces
some
of
us
were
drowned
and
some
escaped
but
the
greater
number
were
drowned
and
of
those
who
saved
their
lives
none
knew
what
became
of
the
others
so
stupefied
were
they
by
the
waves
and
the
boisterous
wind
as
for
myself
o
my
mistress
god
whose
name
be
exalted
spared
me
on
account
of
the
trouble
and
torment
and
affliction
that
he
had
predestined
to
befall
me
i
placed
myself
upon
a
plank
and
the
wind
and
waves
cast
it
upon
the
mountain
and
when
i
had
landed
i
found
a
practicable
way
to
the
summit
resembling
steps
cut
in
the
rock
so
i
exclaimed
in
the
name
of
godâand
offered
up
a
prayer
and
attempted
the
ascent
holding
fast
by
the
notches
and
presently
god
stilled
the
wind
and
assisted
me
in
my
endeavours
so
that
i
arrived
in
safety
at
the
summit
rejoicing
greatly
in
my
escape
i
immediately
entered
the
cupola
and
performed
the
prayers
of
two
rekahs73
in
gratitude
to
god
for
my
preservation
after
which
i
slept
beneath
the
cupola
and
heard
a
voice
saying
to
me
o
son
of
khaáeeb74
when
thou
awakest
from
thy
sleep
dig
beneath
thy
feet
and
thou
wilt
find
a
bow
of
brass
and
three
arrows
of
lead
whereon
are
engraved
talismans
then
take
the
bow
and
arrows
and
shoot
at
the
horseman
that
is
upon
the
top
of
the
cupola
and
relieve
mankind
from
this
great
affliction
for
when
thou
hast
shot
at
the
horseman
he
will
fall
into
the
sea
the
bow
will
also
fall
and
do
thou
bury
it
in
its
place
and
as
soon
as
thou
hast
done
this
the
sea
will
swell
and
rise
until
it163
attains
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
there
will
appear
upon
it
a
boat
bearing
a
man
different
from
him
whom
thou
shalt
have
cast
down
and
he
will
come
to
thee
having
an
oar
in
his
hand
then
do
thou
embark
with
him
but
utter
not
the
name
of
god
and
he
will
convey
thee
in
ten
days
to
a
safe
sea
where
on
thy
arrival
thou
wilt
find
one
who
will
take
thee
to
thy
city
all
this
shall
be
done
if
thou
utter
not
the
name
of
god

awaking
from
my
sleep
i
sprang
up
and
did
as
the
voice
had
directed
i
shot
at
the
horseman
and
he
fell
into
the
sea
and
the
bow
having
fallen
from
my
hand
i
buried
it
the
sea
then
became
troubled
and
rose
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
when
i
had
stood
waiting
there
a
little
while
i
beheld
a
boat
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
approaching
me
i
praised
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
when
the
boat
came
to
me
i
found
in
it
a
man
of
brass
with
a
tablet
of
lead
upon
his
breast
engraven
with
names
and
talismans
without
uttering
a
word
i
embarked
in
the
boat
and
the
man
rowed
me
ten
successive
days
after
which
i
beheld
the
islands
of
security
whereupon
in
the
excess
of
my
joy
i
exclaimed
in
the
name
of
god
there
is
no
deity
but
god
god
is
most
greatâand
as
soon
as
i
had
done
this
he
cast
me
out
of
the
boat
and
sank
in
the
sea

the
prince
thrown
ashore
being
able
to
swim
i
swam
until
night
when
my
arms
and
shoulders
were
tired
and
in
this
perilous
situation
i
repeated
the164
profession
of
the
faith
and
gave
myself
up
as
lost
but
the
sea
rose
with
the
violence
of
the
wind
and
a
wave
like
a
vast
castle
threw
me
upon
the
land
in
order
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
god
i
ascended
the
shore
and
after
i
had
wrung
out
my
clothes
and
spread
them
upon
the
ground
to
dry
i
slept
and
in
the
morning
i
put
on
my
clothes
again
and
looking
about
to
see
which
way
i
should
go
i
found
a
tract
covered
with
trees
to
which
i
advanced
and
when
i
had
walked
round
it
i
found
that
i
was
upon
a
small
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
upon
which
i
said
within
myself
every
time
that
i
escape
from
one
calamity
i
fall
into
another
that
is
worseâbut
while
i
was
reflecting
upon
my
unfortunate
case
and
wishing
for
death
i
beheld
a
vessel
bearing
a
number
of
men
i
arose
immediately
and
climbed
into
a
tree
and
lo
the
vessel
came
to
the
shore
and
there
landed
from
it
ten
black
slaves
bearing
axes
they
proceeded
to
the
middle
of
the
island
and
digging
up
the
earth
uncovered
and
lifted
up
a
trap-door
after
which
they
returned
to
the
vessel
and
brought
from
it
bread
and
flour
and
clarified
butter
and
honey
and
sheep
and
everything
that
the
wants
of
an
inhabitant
would
require
continuing
to
pass
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
vessel
and
the
trap-door
bringing
loads
from
the
former
and
entering
the
latter
until
they
had
removed
all
the
stores
from
the
ship
they
then
came
out
of
the
vessel
with
various
clothes
of
the
most
beautiful
description
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
an
old
sheykh
enfeebled
and
wasted
by
extreme
age
leading
by
the
hand
a
young
man
cast
in
the
mould
of
graceful
symmetry
and
invested
with
such
perfect
beauty
as
deserved
to
be
a
subject
for
proverbs
he
was
like
a
fresh
and
slender
twig
enchanting
and
captivating
every
heart
by
his
elegant
form
the
party
proceeded
to
the
trap-door
and
entering
it
became
concealed
from
my
eyes75

they
remained
beneath
about
two
hours
or
more
after
which
the
sheykh
and
the
slaves
came
out
but
the
youth
came
not
with
them
and
they
replaced
the
earth
and
embarked
and
set
sail
soon
after
i
descended
from
the
tree
and
went
to
the
excavation
i
removed
the
earth
and
entering
the
aperture
saw
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
which
i
descended
and
at
the
bottom
i
beheld
a
handsome
dwelling-place
furnished
with
a
variety
of
silken
carpets
and
there
was
the
youth
sitting
upon
a
high
mattress
with
sweet-smelling
flowers
and
fruits
placed
before
him
on
seeing
me
his
countenance
became
pale
but
i
saluted
him
and
said
let
thy
mind
be
composed
o
my
master
thou
hast
nothing
to
fear
o
delight
of
my
eye
for
i
am
a
man
and
the
son
of
a
king
like
thyself
fate
hath
impelled
me
to165
thee
that
i
may
cheer
thee
in
thy
solitude
the
youth
when
he
heard
me
thus
address
him
and
was
convinced
that
i
was
one
of
his
own
species
rejoiced
exceedingly
at
my
arrival
his
colour
returned
and
desiring
me
to
approach
him
he
said
o
my
brother
my
story
is
wonderful
my
father
is
a
jeweller
he
had
slaves
who
made
voyages
by
his
orders
for
the
purposes
of
commerce
and
he
had
dealings
with
kings
but
he
had
never
been
blest
with
a
son
and
he
dreamt
that
he
was
soon
to
have
a
son
but
one
whose
life
would
be
short
and
he
awoke
sorrowful76
shortly
after
in
accordance
with
the
decrees
of
god
my
mother
conceived
me
and
when
her
time
was
complete
she
gave
birth
to
me
and
my
father
was
greatly
rejoiced
the
astrologers
however
came
to
him
and
said
thy
son
will
live
fifteen
years
his
fate
is
intimated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
in
the
sea
a
mountain
called
the
mountain
of
loadstone
whereon
is
a
horseman
on
a
horse
of
brass
on
the
former
of
which
is
a
tablet
of
lead
suspended
to
his
neck
and
when
the
horseman
shall
be
thrown
down
from
his
horse
thy
son
will
be
slain
the
person
who
is
to
slay
him
is
he
who
will
throw
down
the
horseman
and
his
name
is
king
ajeeb77
the
son
of
king
khaáeeb
my
father
was
greatly
afflicted
at
this
announcement
and
when
he
had
reared
me
until
i
had
nearly
attained
the
age
of
fifteen
years
the
astrologers
came
again
and
informed
him
that
the
horseman
had
fallen
into
the
sea
and
that
it
had
been
thrown
down
by
king
ajeeb
the
son
of
king
khaáeeb
on
hearing
which
he
prepared
for
me
this
dwelling
and
here
left
me
to
remain
until
the
completion
of
the
term
of
which
there
now
remain
ten
days
all
this
he
did
from
fear
lest
king
ajeeb
should
kill
me

when
i
heard
this
i
was
filled
with
wonder
and
said
within
myself
i
am
king
ajeeb
the
son
of
king
khaáeeb
and
it
was
i
who
threw
down
the
horseman
but
by
allah
i
will
neither
kill
him
nor
do
him
any
injury
then
said
i
to
the
youth
far
from
thee
be
both
destruction
and
harm
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
thou
hast
nothing
to
fear
i
will
remain
with
thee
to
serve
thee
and
will
go
forth
with
thee
to
thy
father
and
beg
of
him
to
send
me
back
to
my
country
for
the
which
he
will
obtain
a
reward
the
youth
rejoiced
at
my
words
and
i
sat
and
conversed
with
him
until
night
when
i
spread
his
bed
for
him
and
covered
him
and
slept
near
to
his
side
and
in
the
morning
i
brought
him
water
and
he
washed
his
face
and
said
to
me
may
god
requite
thee
for
me
with
every
blessing
if
i
escape
from
king
ajeeb
i
will
make
my
father
reward
thee
with
abundant
favoursânever
i
replied
may
the
day
arrive
that
would166
bring
thee
misfortune
i
then
placed
before
him
some
refreshments
and
after
we
had
eaten
together
we
passed
the
day
conversing
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness

death
of
the
youth
in
the
cave
i
continued
to
serve
him
for
nine
days
and
on
the
tenth
day
the
youth
rejoiced
at
finding
himself
in
safety
and
said
to
me
o
my
brother
i
wish
that
thou
wouldst
in
thy
kindness
warm
for
me
some
water
that
i
may
wash
myself
and
change
my
clothes
for
i
have
smelt
the
odour
of
escape
from
death
in
consequence
of
thy
assistance
âwith
pleasure
i
repliedâand
i
arose
and
warmed
the
water
after
which
he
entered
a
place
concealed
from
my
view
and
having
washed
himself
and
changed
his
clothes
laid
himself
upon
the
mattress
to
rest
after
his
bath
he
then
said
to
me
cut
up
for
me
o
my
brother
a
water-melon
and
mix
its
juice
with
some
sugarâso
i
arose
and
taking
a
melon
brought
it
upon
a
plate
and
said
to
him
knowest
thou
o
my
master
where
is
the
knifeâsee
here
it
is
he
answered
upon
the
shelf
over
my
head
i
sprang
up
hastily
and167
took
it
from
its
sheath
and
as
i
was
drawing
back
my
foot
slipped
as
god
had
decreed
and
i
fell
upon
the
youth
grasping
in
my
hand
the
knife
which
entered
his
body
and
he
died
instantly
when
i
perceived
that
he
was
dead
and
that
i
had
killed
him
i
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
beat
my
face
and
rent
my
clothes
saying
this
is
indeed
a
calamity
o
what
a
calamity
o
my
lord
i
implore
thy
pardon
and
declare
to
thee
my
innocence
of
his
death
would
that
i
had
died
before
him
how
long
shall
i
devour
trouble
after
trouble

with
these
reflections
i
ascended
the
steps
and
having
replaced
the
trap-door
returned
to
my
first
station
and
looked
over
the
sea
where
i
saw
the
vessel
that
had
come
before
approaching
and
cleaving
the
waves
in
its
rapid
course
upon
this
i
said
within
myself
now
will
the
men
come
forth
from
the
vessel
and
find
the
youth
slain
and
they
will
slay
me
alsoâso
i
climbed
into
a
tree
and
concealed
myself
among
its
leaves
and
sat
there
till
the
vessel
arrived
and
cast
anchor
when
the
slaves
landed
with
the
old
sheykh
the
father
of
the
youth
and
went
to
the
place
and
removed
the
earth
they
were
surprised
at
finding
it
moist
and
when
they
had
descended
the
steps
they
discovered
the
youth
lying
on
his
back
exhibiting
a
face
beaming
with
beauty
though
dead
and
clad
in
white
and
clean
clothing
with
the
knife
remaining
in
his
body
they
all
wept
at
the
sight
and
the
father
fell
down
in
a
swoon
which
lasted
so
long
that
the
slaves
thought
he
was
dead
at
length
however
he
recovered
and
came
out
with
the
slaves
who
had
wrapped
the
body
of
the
youth
in
his
clothes
they
then
took
back
all
that
was
in
the
subterranean
dwelling
to
the
vessel
and
departed

i
remained
o
my
mistress
by
day
hiding
myself
in
a
tree
and
at
night
walking
about
the
open
part
of
the
island
thus
i
continued
for
the
space
of
two
months
and
i
perceived
that
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
the
water
of
the
sea
every
day
retired
until
after
three
months
the
land
that
had
been
beneath
it
became
dry
rejoicing
at
this
and
feeling
confident
now
in
my
escape
i
traversed
this
dry
tract
and
arrived
at
an
expanse
of
sand
whereupon
i
emboldened
myself
and
crossed
it
i
then
saw
in
the
distance
an
appearance
of
fire
and
advancing
towards
it
found
it
to
be
a
palace
overlaid
with
plates
of
copper
which
reflecting
the
rays
of
the
sun
seemed
from
a
distance
to
be
fire
and
when
i
drew
near
to
it
reflecting
upon
this
sight
there
approached
me
an
old
sheykh
accompanied
by
ten
young
men
who
were
all
blind
of
one
eye
at
which
i168
was
extremely
surprised
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
they
saluted
me
and
asked
me
my
story
which
i
related
to
them
from
first
to
last
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
they
then
conducted
me
into
the
palace
where
i
saw
ten
benches
upon
each
of
which
was
a
mattress
covered
with
a
blue
stuff78
and
each
of
the
young
men
seated
himself
upon
one
of
these
benches
while
the
sheykh
took
his
place
upon
a
smaller
one
after
which
they
said
to
me
sit
down
o
young
man
and
ask
no
question
respecting
our
condition
nor
respecting
our
being
blind
of
one
eye
then
the
sheykh
arose
and
brought
to
each
of
them
some
food
and
the
same
to
me
also
and
next
he
brought
to
each
of
us
some
wine
and
after
we
had
eaten
we
sat
drinking
together
until
the
time
for
sleep
when
the
young
men
said
to
the
sheykh
bring
to
us
our
accustomed
supplyâupon
which
the
sheykh
arose
and
entered
a
closet
from
which
he
brought
upon
his
head
ten
covered
trays
placing
these
upon
the
floor
he
lighted
ten
candles
and
stuck
one
of
them
upon
each
tray
and
having
done
this
he
removed
the
covers
and
there
appeared
beneath
them
ashes
mixed
with
pounded
charcoal
the
young
men
then
tucked
up
their
sleeves
above
the
elbow
and
blackened
their
faces
and
slapped
their
cheeks79
exclaiming
we
were
reposing
at
our
ease
and
our
impertinent
curiosity
suffered
us
not
to
remain
so
thus
they
did
until
the
morning
when
the
sheykh
brought
them
some
hot
water
and
they
washed
their
faces
and
put
on
other
clothes

on
witnessing
this
conduct
my
reason
was
confounded
my
heart
was
so
troubled
that
i
forgot
my
own
misfortunes
and
i
asked
them
the
cause
of
their
strange
behaviour
upon
which
they
looked
towards
me
and
said
o
young
man
ask
not
respecting
that
which
doth
not
concern
thee
but
be
silent
for
in
silence
is
security
from
errorâi
remained
with
them
a
whole
month
during
which
every
night
they
did
the
same
and
at
length
i
said
to
them
i
conjure
you
by
allah
to
remove
this
disquiet
from
my
mind
and
to
inform
me
of
the
cause
of
your
acting
in
this
manner
and
of
your
exclaiming
we
were
reposing
at
our
ease
and
our
impertinent
curiosity
suffered
us
not
to
remain
soâif
ye
inform
me
not
i
will
leave
you
and
go
my
way
for
the
proverb
saith
when
the
eye
seeth
not
the
heart
doth
not
grieveâon
hearing
these
words
they
replied
we
have
not
concealed
this
affair
from
thee
but
in
our
concern
for
thy
welfare
lest
thou
shouldst
become
like
us
and
the
same
affliction
that
hath
befallen
us
happen
also
to
thee
i
said
however
ye
must
positively
inform
me
of
this
matterâwe
give
thee
good
advice
said
they
and
do
thou169
receive
it
and
ask
us
not
respecting
our
case
otherwise
thou
wilt
become
blind
of
one
eye
like
usâbut
i
still
persisted
in
my
request
whereupon
they
said
o
young
man
if
this
befall
thee
know
that
thou
wilt
be
banished
from
our
company
they
then
all
arose
and
taking
a
ram
slaughtered
and
skinned
it
and
said
to
me
take
this
knife
with
thee
and
introduce
thyself
into
the
skin
of
the
ram
and
we
will
sew
thee
up
in
it
and
go
away
whereupon
a
bird
called
the
rukh80
will
come
to
thee
and
taking
thee
up
by
its
talons
will
fly
away
with
thee
and
set
thee
down
upon
a
mountain
then
cut
open
the
skin
with
this
knife
and
get
out
and
the
bird
will
fly
away
thou
must
arise
as
soon
as
it
hath
gone
and
journey
for
half
a
day
and
thou
wilt
see
before
thee
a
lofty
palace
encased
with
red
gold
set
with
various
precious
stones
such
as
emeralds
and
rubies
c
and
if
thou
enter
it
thy
case
will
be
as
ours
for
our
entrance
into
that
palace
was
the
cause
of
our
being
blind
of
one
eye
and
if
one
of
us
would
relate
to
thee
all
that
hath
befallen
him
his
story
would
be
too
long
for
thee
to
hear

they
then
sewed
me
up
in
the
skin
and
entered
their
palace
and
soon
after
there
came
an
enormous
white
bird
which
seized
me
and
flew
away
with
me
and
set
me
down
upon
the
mountain
whereupon
i
cut
open
the
skin
and
got
out
and
the
bird
as
soon
as
it
saw
me
flew
away
i
rose
up
quickly
and
proceeded
towards
the
palace
which
i
found
to
be
as
they
had
described
it
to
me
and
when
i
had
entered
it
i
beheld
at
the
upper
end
of
a
saloon
forty
young
damsels
beautiful
as
so
many
moons
and
magnificently
attired
who
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
exclaimed
welcome
welcome
o
our
master
and
our
lord
we
have
been
for
a
month
expecting
thee
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
blessed
us
with
one
who
is
worthy
of
us
and
one
of
whom
we
are
worthyâafter
having
thus
greeted
me
they
seated
me
upon
a
mattress
and
said
thou
art
from
this
day
our
master
and
prince
and
we
are
thy
handmaids
and
entirely
under
thy
authority
they
then
brought
to
me
some
refreshments
and
when
i
had
eaten
and
drunk
they
sat
and
conversed
with
me
full
of
joy
and
happiness
so
lovely
were
these
ladies
that
even
a
devotee
if
he
saw
them
would
gladly
consent
to
be
their
servant
and
to
comply
with
all
that
they
would
desire
at
the
approach
of
night
they
all
assembled
around
me
and
placed
before
me
a
table
of
fresh
and
dried
fruits
with
other
delicacies
that
the
tongue
cannot
describe
and
wine
and
one
began
to
sing
while
another
played
upon
the
lute
the
wine-cups
circulated
among
us
and
joy
overcame
me
to
such
a
degree
as
to
obliterate
from170
my
mind
every
earthly
care
and
make
me
exclaim
this
is
indeed
a
delightful
life
i
passed
a
night
of
such
enjoyment
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
and
on
the
morrow
i
entered
the
bath
and
after
i
had
washed
myself
they
brought
me
a
suit
of
the
richest
clothing
and
we
again
sat
down
to
a
repast

in
this
manner
i
lived
with
them
a
whole
year
but
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
they
seated
themselves
around
me
and
began
to
weep
and
bade
me
farewell
clinging
to
my
skirtsâwhat
calamity
hath
befallen
you
said
i
ye
have
broken
my
heartâthey
answered
would
that
we
had
never
known
thee
for
we
have
associated
with
many
men
but
have
seen
none
like
thee
may
god
therefore
not
deprive
us
of
thy
companyâand
they
wept
afresh
i
said
to
them
i
wish
that
you
would
acquaint
me
with
the
cause
of
this
weepingâthou
they
replied
art
the
cause
yet
now
if
thou
wilt
attend
to
what
we
tell
thee
we
shall
never
be
parted
but
if
thou
act
contrary
to
it
we
are
separated
from
this
time
and
our
hearts
whisper
to
us
that
thou
wilt
not
regard
our
warningâinform
me
said
i
and
i
will
attend
to
your
directionsâand
they
replied
if
then
thou
wouldst
inquire
respecting
our
history
know
that
we
are
the
daughters
of
kings
for
many
years
it
hath
been
our
custom
to
assemble
here
and
every
year
we
absent
ourselves
during
a
period
of
forty
days
then
returning
we
indulge
ourselves
for
a
year
in
feasting
and
drinking
this
is
our
usual
practice
and
now
we
fear
that
thou
wilt
disregard
our
directions
when
we
are
absent
from
thee
we
deliver
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
palace
which
are
a
hundred
in
number
belonging
to
a
hundred
closets
open
each
of
these
and
amuse
thyself
and
eat
and
drink
and
refresh
thyself
excepting
the
closet
that
hath
a
door
of
red
gold
for
if
thou
open
this
the
consequence
will
be
a
separation
between
us
and
thee
we
conjure
thee
therefore
to
observe
our
direction
and
to
be
patient
during
this
periodâupon
hearing
this
i
swore
to
them
that
i
would
never
open
the
closet
to
which
they
alluded
and
they
departed
urging
me
to
be
faithful
to
my
promise

garden
i
remained
alone
in
the
palace
and
at
the
approach
of
evening
i
opened
the
first
closet
and
entering
it
found
a
mansion
like
paradise
with
a
garden
containing
green
trees
loaded
with
ripe
fruits
abounding
with
singing
birds
and
watered
by
copious
streams
my
heart
was
soothed
by
the
sight
and
i
wandered
among
the
trees
scenting
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
and
listening
to
the
warbling
of
the
birds
as
they
sang
the
praises
of
the
one
the
almighty81
after
admiring
the
mingled
colours
of
the
apple
resembling
the
hue
upon
the
cheek
of
a171
beloved
mistress
and
the
sallow
countenance
of
the
perplexed
and
timid
lover
the
sweet-smelling
quince
diffusing
an
odour
like
musk
and
ambergris
and
the
plum
shining
as
the
ruby
i
retired
from
this
place
and
having
locked
the
door
opened
that
of
the
next
closet
within
which
i
beheld
a
spacious
tract
planted
with
numerous
palm-trees
and
watered
by
a
river
flowing
among
rose-trees
and
jasmine
and
marjoram
and
eglantine
and
narcissus
and
gilliflower
the
odours
of
which
diffused
in
every
direction
by
the
wind
inspired
me
with
the
utmost
delight
i
locked
again
the
door
of
the
second
closet
and
opened
that
of
the
third
within
this
i
found
a
large
saloon
paved
with
marbles
of
various
colours
and
with
costly
minerals
and
precious
gems
and
containing
cages
constructed
of
sandal
and
aloes-wood
with
singing
birds
within
them
and
others
upon
the
branches
of
trees
which
were
planted
there
my
heart
was
charmed
my
trouble
was
dissipated
and
i
slept
there
until
the
morning
i
then
opened
the
door
of
the
fourth
closet
and
within
this
door
i
found
a
great
building
in
which172
were
forty
closets
with
open
doors
and
entering
these
i
beheld
pearls
and
rubies
and
chrysolites
and
emeralds
and
other
precious
jewels
such
as
the
tongue
cannot
describe
i
was
astonished
at
the
sight
and
said
such
things
as
these
i
imagine
are
not
found
in
the
treasury
of
any
king
i
am
now
the
king
of
my
age
and
all
these
treasures
through
the
goodness
of
god
are
mine
together
with
forty
damsels
under
my
authority
who
have
no
man
to
share
them
with
me

thus
i
continued
to
amuse
myself
passing
from
one
place
to
another
until
thirty-nine
days
had
elapsed
and
i
had
opened
the
doors
of
all
the
closets
excepting
that
which
they
had
forbidden
me
to
open
my
heart
was
then
disturbed
by
curiosity
respecting
this
hundredth
closet
and
the
devil
in
order
to
plunge
me
into
misery
induced
me
to
open
it
i
had
not
patience
to
abstain
though
there
remained
of
the
appointed
period
only
one
day
so
i
approached
the
closet
and
opened
the
door
and
when
i
had
entered
i
perceived
a
fragrant
odour
such
as
i
had
never
before
smelt
which
intoxicated
me
so
that
i
fell
down
insensible
and
remained
some
time
in
this
state
but
at
length
recovering
i
fortified
my
heart
and
proceeded
i
found
the
floor
overspread
with
saffron
and
the
place
illuminated
by
golden
lamps
and
by
candles
which
diffused
the
odours
of
musk
and
ambergris
and
two
large
perfuming-vessels
filled
with
aloes-wood
and
ambergris
and
a
perfume
compounded
with
honey
spread
fragrance
through
the
whole
place
i
saw
also
a
black
horse
of
the
hue
of
the
darkest
night
before
which
was
a
manger
of
white
crystal
filled
with
cleansed
sesame
and
another
similar
to
it
containing
rose-water
infused
with
musk
he
was
saddled
and
bridled
and
his
saddle
was
of
red
gold
wondering
at
the
sight
of
him
i
said
within
myself
this
must
be
an
animal
of
extraordinary
qualitiesâand
seduced
by
the
devil
i
led
him
out
and
mounted
him
but
he
moved
not
from
his
place
i
kicked
him
with
my
heel
but
still
he
moved
not
so
i
took
a
miáraah
and
struck
him
with
it
and
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
blow
he
uttered
a
sound
like
thunder
and
expanding
a
pair
of
wings
soared
with
me
to
an
immense
height
through
the
air
and
then
alighted
upon
the
roof
of
another
palace
where
he
threw
me
from
his
back
and
by
a
violent
blow
with
his
tail
upon
my
face
as
i
sat
on
the
roof
struck
out
my
eye
and
left
me82

in
this
state
i
descended
from
the
roof
and
below
i
found
the
one-eyed
young
men
before
mentioned
who
as
soon
as
they
beheld
me
exclaimed
no
welcome
to
theeâreceive
me
said
i
into
your
companyâbut
they
replied
by
allah
thou
shalt
not
remain
with173
usâso
i
departed
from
them
with
mournful
heart
and
weeping
eye
and
god
having
decreed
me
a
safe
journey
hither
i
arrived
at
baghdÃd
after
i
had
shaved
my
beard
and
become
a
mendicant83

continuation
of
the
story
of
the
ladies
of
baghdÃd
c

the
mistress
of
the
house
then
looked
towards
the
khaleefeh
and
jaáºfar
and
mesroor
and
said
to
them
acquaint
me
with
your
historiesâupon
which
jaáºfar
advanced
towards
her
and
related
to
her
the
same
story
that
he
had
told
to
the
portress
before
they
entered
and
when
she
had
heard
it
she
liberated
them
all
they
accordingly
departed
and
when
they
had
gone
out
into
the
street
the
khaleefeh
inquired
of
the
mendicants
whither
they
were
going
they
answered
that
they
knew
not
whither
to
go
whereupon
he
desired
them
to
accompany
his
party
and
then
said
to
jaáºfar
take
them
home
with
thee
and
bring
them
before
me
to-morrow
and
we
will
see
the
result
jaáºfar
therefore
did
as
he
was
commanded
and
the
khaleefeh
returned
to
his
palace
but
he
was
unable
to
sleep
during
the
remainder
of
the
night

on
the
following
morning
he
sat
upon
his
throne
and
when
his
courtiers
had
presented
themselves
before
him
and
departed
excepting
jaáºfar
he
said
to
him
bring
before
me
the
three
ladies
and
the
two
bitches
and
the
mendicants
so
jaáºfar
arose
and
brought
them
and
placing
the
ladies
behind
the
curtains
said
to
them
we
have
forgiven
you
on
account
of
your
previous
kindness
to
us
and
because
ye
knew
us
not
and
now
i
acquaint
you
that
ye
are
in
the
presence
of
the
fifth
of
the
sons
of
el-abbÃs
hÃroon
er-rasheed
therefore
relate
to
him
nothing
but
the
truth
and
when
the
ladies
heard
the
words
which
jaáºfar
addressed
to
them
on
the
part
of
the
khaleefeh
the
eldest
of
them
advanced
and
thus
related
her
storyâ

the
story
of
the
first
of
the
three
ladies
of
baghdÃd

o
prince
of
the
faithful
my
story
is
wonderful
for
these
two
bitches84
are
my
sisters
born
to
my
father
but
of
another
mother
and
i
am
the
youngest
of
the
three
after
the
death
of
our
father
who
left
us
five
thousand
pieces
of
gold
these
my
two
sisters
married
and
when
they
had
resided
some
time
with
their
husbands
each
of
the174
latter
prepared
a
stock
of
merchandise
and
received
from
his
wife
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
they
all
set
forth
on
a
journey
together
leaving
me
here
but
after
they
had
been
absent
four
years
my
sisters
husbands
lost
all
their
property
and
abandoned
them
in
a
strange
land
and
they
returned
to
me
in
the
garb
of
beggars
when
i
first
saw
them
in
this
state
i
knew
them
not
and
as
soon
as
i
recognised
them
i
exclaimed
how
is
it
that
ye
are
in
this
conditionâo
our
sister
they
answered
thy
inquiry
now
is
of
no
use
the
pen
hath
written
what
god
hath
decreed85âi
sent
them
therefore
to
the
bath
and
having
clad
them
in
new
apparel
said
to
them
o
my
sisters
ye
are
my
elders
and
i
am
young
so
ye
shall
be
to
me
in
the
places
of
my
father
and
mother
the
inheritance
which
i
shared
with
you
god
hath
blessed
partake
then
of
its
increase
for
my
affairs
are
prosperous
and
i
and
ye
shall
fare
alikeâi
treated
them
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
during
a
whole
year
they
remained
with
me
and
enriched
themselves
by
the
money
that
i
had
given
them
but
after
this
period
they
said
to
me
it
will
be
more
agreeable
to
us
to
marry
again
for
we
can
no
longer
abstain
from
doing
soâo
my
sisters
i
replied
ye
have
seen
no
happiness
in
marriage
a
good
husband
in
this
age
is
rarely
found
and
ye
have
already
had
experience
of
the
marriage-state
they
however
heeded
not
my
words
but
married
against
my
consent
yet
i
gave
them
dowries
from
my
own
property
and
continued
to
them
my
protection
they
went
to
their
husbands
and
the
latter
after
they
had
resided
with
them
a
short
time
defrauded
them
of
all
that
they
possessed
and
setting175
forth
on
a
journey
left
them
destitute
so
again
they
returned
to
me
and
in
a
state
of
nudity
implored
my
forgiveness
saying
be
not
angry
with
us
for
though
thou
art
younger
than
we
thou
hast
more
mature
sense
and
we
promise
thee
that
we
will
never
again
mention
the
subject
of
marriage
i
replied
ye
are
welcome
o
my
sisters
for
i
have
no
one
dearer
to
me
than
yourselvesâand
i
received
them
and
treated
them
with
every
kindness
and
we
remained
happily
together
for
the
space
of
a
year

first
lady
recognising
her
sisters
after
this
i
resolved
to
fit
out
a
vessel
for
a
mercantile
voyage86
accordingly
i
stocked
a
large
ship
with
various
goods
and
necessary
provisions
and
said
to
my
sisters
will
ye
rather
stay
at
home
during
my
voyage
or
will
ye
go
with
meâto
which
they
answered
we
will
accompany
thee
during
the
voyage
for
we
cannot
endure
to
be
separated
from
thee
i
therefore
took
them
with
me
and
we
set
sail
but
first
i
divided
my
property
into
two
equal
portions
one
of
which
i
took
with
me
and
the
other
i
concealed
saying
within
myself
perhaps
some
evil
accident
may
happen
to
the
ship
and
our
lives
may
be
prolonged
in
which
case
when
we
return
we
shall
find
that
which
will
be
of
service
to
usâwe
continued
our
voyage
by
day
and
night
till
at
length
the
vessel
pursued
a
wrong
course
and
the
captain
knew
not
whither
to
steer
the
ship
had
entered
a
different
sea
from
that
which
we
wished
to
cross
and
for
some
time
we
knew
it
not
but
for
ten
days
we
had
a
pleasant
wind
and
after
this
a
city
loomed
before
us
in
the
distance
we
asked
the
captain
what
was
the
name
of
this
city
and
he
answered
i
know
it
not
i
have
never
seen
it
till
this
day
nor
have
i
ever
before
in
the
course
of
my
life
navigated
this
sea
but
as
we
have
come
hither
in
safety
ye
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
enter
this
city
and
land
your
goods
and
if
ye
find
opportunity
sell
or
exchange
there
if
not
we
will
rest
there
two
days
and
take
in
fresh
provisions
so
we
entered
the
port
of
the
city
and
the
captain
landed
and
after
a
while
returned
to
us
saying
arise
and
go
up
into
the
city
and
wonder
at
that
which
god
hath
done
unto
his
creatures
and
pray
to
be
preserved
from
his
anger
and
when
we
had
entered
the
city
we
found
all
its
inhabitants
converted
into
black
stones
we
were
amazed
at
the
sight
and
as
we
walked
through
the
market-streets
finding
the
merchandise
and
the
gold
and
silver
remaining
in
their
original
state
we
rejoiced
and
said
this
must
have
been
occasioned
by
same
wonderful
circumstance
we
then
separated
in
the
streets
each
of
us
attracted
from
his
companions
by
the
wealth
and
stuffs
in
the
shops176

as
for
myself
i
ascended
to
the
citadel
which
i
found
to
be
a
building
of
admirable
construction
and
entering
the
kings
palace
i
found
all
the
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
remaining
in
their
places
and
the
king
himself
seated
in
the
midst
of
his
chamberlains
and
viceroys
and
wezeers
and
clad
in
apparel
of
astonishing
richness
drawing
nearer
to
him
i
perceived
that
he
was
sitting
upon
a
throne
adorned
with
pearls
and
jewels
every
one
of
the
pearls
shining
like
a
star
his
dress
was
embroidered
with
gold
and
around
him
stood
fifty
memlooks
attired
in
silks
of
various
descriptions
and
having
in
their
hands
drawn
swords
stupefied
at
this
spectacle
i
proceeded
and
entered
the
saloon
of
the
áareem
upon
the
walls
of
which
were
hung
silken
curtains
and
here
i
beheld
the
queen
attired
in
a
dress
embroidered
with
fresh
pearls
and
having
upon
her
head
a
diadem
adorned
with
various
jewels
and
necklaces
of
different
kinds
on
her
neck
all
her
clothing
and
ornaments
remained
as
they
were
at
first
though
she
herself
was
converted
into
black
stone
here
also
i
found
an
open
door
and
entering
it
i
saw
a
flight
of
seven
steps
by
which
i
ascended
to
an
apartment
paved
with
marble
furnished
with
gold-embroidered
carpets
and
containing
a
couch
of
alabaster
ornamented
with
pearls
and
jewels
but
my
eyes
were
first
attracted
by
a
gleam
of
light
and
when
i
approached
the
spot
whence
it
proceeded
i
found
a
brilliant
jewel
of
the
size
of
an
ostrichs
egg
placed
upon
a
small
stool
diffusing
a
light
like
that
of
a
candle
the
coverings
of
the
couch
above
mentioned
were
of
various
kinds
of
silk
the
richness
of
which
would
surprise
every
beholder
and
i
looked
at
them
with
wonder
in
this
apartment
i
likewise
observed
some
lighted
candles
and
reflected
that
there
must
then
have
been
some
person
there
to
light
them
i
passed
thence
to
another
part
of
the
palace
and
continued
to
explore
the
different
apartments
forgetting
myself
in
the
amazement
of
my
mind
at
all
these
strange
circumstances
and
immersed
in
thoughts
respecting
what
i
beheld
until
the
commencement
of
night
when
i
would
have
departed
but
could
not
find
the
door
so
i
returned
to
the
place
in
which
were
the
lighted
candles
and
there
i
laid
myself
upon
the
couch
and
covering
myself
with
a
quilt
repeated
some
words
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
endeavoured
to
compose
myself
to
sleep
but
i
could
not
i
continued
restless
and
at
midnight
i
heard
a
recitation
of
the
áur-Ãn
performed
by
a
melodious
and
soft
voice
upon
which
i
arose
and
looking
about
saw
a
closet
with
an
open
door
and
i
entered
it
and
found
that
it
was
an
oratory
lighted
lamps
were
suspended
in
it
and
upon
a
prayer-carpet
spread
on
the
floor
sat
a177
young
man
of
handsome
aspect
wondering
that
he
had
escaped
the
fate
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
city
i
saluted
him
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
returned
my
salutation
and
i
then
said
to
him
i
conjure
thee
by
the
truth
of
that
which
thou
art
reading
in
the
book
of
god
that
thou
answer
the
question
which
i
am
about
to
ask
theeâwhereupon
he
smiled
and
replied
do
thou
first
acquaint
me
with
the
cause
of
thine
entrance
into
this
place
and
then
i
will
answer
thy
question
so
i
told
him
my
story
and
inquired
of
him
the
history
of
this
city
wait
a
little
said
heâand
he
closed
the
áur-Ãn
and
having
put
it
in
a
bag
of
satin
seated
me
by
his
side
as
i
now
beheld
him
his
countenance
appeared
like
the
full
moon
and
his
whole
person
exhibited
such
perfect
elegance
and
loveliness
that
a
single
glance
at
him
drew
from
me
a
thousand
sighs
and
kindled
a
fire
in
my
heart
i
repeated
my
request
that
he
would
give
me
an
account
of
the
city
and
replying
i
hear
and
obey
he
thus
addressed
meâ

the
prince
in
the
oratory
know
that
this
city
belonged
to
my
father
and
his
family
and
subjects
and
he
is
the
king
whom
thou
hast
seen
converted
into178
stone
and
the
queen
whom
thou
hast
seen
is
my
mother
they
were
all
magians
worshipping
fire
in
the
place
of
the
almighty
king87
and
they
swore
by
the
fire
and
the
light
and
the
shade
and
the
heat
and
the
revolving
orb
my
father
had
no
son
till
in
his
declining
years
he
was
blest
with
me
whom
he
reared
until
i
attained
to
manhood
but
happily
for
me
there
was
in
our
family
an
old
woman
far
advanced
in
age
who
was
a
muslimeh
believing
in
god
and
his
apostle
in
her
heart
though
she
conformed
with
my
family
in
outward
observances
and
my
father
confided
in
her
on
account
of
the
faithfulness
and
modesty
that
he
had
observed
in
her
character
and
shewed
her
great
favour
firmly
believing
that
she
held
the
same
faith
as
himself
therefore
when
i
had
passed
my
infancy
he
committed
me
to
her
care
saying
take
him
and
rear
him
and
instruct
him
in
the
ordinances
of
our
faith
and
educate
him
and
serve
him
in
the
best
manner
the
old
woman
accordingly
received
me
but
took
care
to
instruct
me
in
the
faith
of
el-islÃm
teaching
me
the
laws
of
purification
and
the
divine
ordinances
of
ablution
together
with
the
forms
of
prayer
after
which
she
made
me
commit
to
memory
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
she
then
charged
me
to
keep
my
faith
a
secret
from
my
father
lest
he
should
kill
me
and
i
did
so
and
a
few
days
after
the
old
woman
died
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
had
now
increased
in
their
impiety
and
arrogance
and
in
their
dereliction
of
the
truth
and
while
they
were
in
this
state
they
heard
a
crier
proclaim
with
a
voice
like
thunder
so
as
to
be
audible
to
both
the
near
and
the
distant
o
inhabitants
of
this
city
abstain
from
the
worship
of
fire
and
worship
the
almighty
kingâthe
people
were
struck
with
consternation
and
flocking
to
my
father
the
king
of
the
city
said
to
him
what
is
this
alarming
voice
which
hath
astounded
us
by
its
terrible
soundâbut
he
answered
them
let
not
the
voice
terrify
you
nor
let
it
turn
you
from
your
faithâand
their
hearts
inclined
to
his
words
so
they
persevered
in
the
worship
of
fire
and
remained
obstinate
in
their
impiety
during
another
year
until
the
return
of
the
period
at
which
they
had
heard
the
voice
the
first
time
it
was
then
heard
a
second
time
and
again
in
the
next
year
they
heard
it
a
third
time
but
still
they
persisted
in
their
evil
ways
until
drawing
down
upon
themselves
the
abhorrence
and
indignation
of
heaven
one
morning
shortly
after
daybreak
they
were
converted
into
black
stones
together
with
their
beasts
and
all
their
cattle
not
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
escaped
excepting
me
and
from
the
day
on
which
this
catastrophe
happened
i
have
continued
occupied
as
thou
seest
in
prayer
and179
fasting
and
reading
the
áur-Ãn
but
i
have
become
weary
of
this
solitary
state
having
no
one
to
cheer
me
with
his
company

on
hearing
these
words
i
said
to
him
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
the
city
of
baghdÃd
and
visit
its
learned
men
and
lawyers
and
increase
thy
knowledge
if
so
i
will
be
thy
handmaid
though
i
am
the
mistress
of
my
family
and
have
authority
over
a
household
of
men
i
have
here
a
ship
laden
with
merchandise
and
destiny
hath
driven
us
to
this
city
in
order
that
we
might
become
acquainted
with
these
events
our
meeting
was
predestinedâin
this
manner
i
continued
to
persuade
him
until
he
gave
his
consent
i
slept
that
night
at
his
feet
unconscious
of
my
state
through
excessive
joy
and
in
the
morning
we
rose
and
entering
the
treasuries
took
away
a
quantity
of
the
lighter
and
most
valuable
of
the
articles
that
they
contained
and
descended
from
the
citadel
into
the
city
where
we
met
the
slaves
and
the
captain
who
were
searching
for
me
they
were
rejoiced
at
seeing
me
and
to
their
questions
respecting
my
absence
i
replied
by
informing
them
of
all
that
i
had
seen
and
related
to
them
the
history
of
the
young
man
and
the
cause
of
the
transmutation
of
the
people
of
the
city
and
of
all
that
had
befallen
them
which
filled
them
with
wonder
but
when
my
two
sisters
saw
me
with
the
young
man
they
envied
me
on
his
account
and
malevolently
plotted
against
me

we
embarked
again
and
i
experienced
the
utmost
happiness
chiefly
owing
to
the
company
of
the
young
man
and
after
we
had
waited
a
while
till
the
wind
was
favourable
we
spread
our
sails
and
departed
my
sisters
sat
with
me
and
the
young
man
and
in
their
conversation
with
me
said
o
our
sister
what
dost
thou
purpose
to
do
with
this
handsome
youth
i
answered
i
desire
to
take
him
as
my
husbandâand
turning
to
him
and
approaching
him
i
said
o
my
master
i
wish
to
make
a
proposal
to
thee
and
do
not
thou
oppose
it
he
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
i
then
looked
towards
my
sisters
and
said
to
them
this
young
man
is
all
that
i
desire
and
all
the
wealth
that
is
here
is
yoursâexcellent
they
replied
is
thy
determinationâyet
still
they
designed
evil
against
meâwe
continued
our
voyage
with
a
favourable
wind
and
quitting
the
sea
of
peril
entered
the
sea
of
security
across
which
we
proceeded
for
some
days
until
we
drew
near
to
the
city
of
el-baárah
the
buildings
of
which
loomed
before
us
at
the
approach
of
evening
but
as
soon
as
we
had
fallen
asleep
my
sisters
took
us
up
in
our
bed
both
myself
and
the
young
man
and
threw
us
into
the
sea
the
youth
being
unable
to
swim
was
drowned
god
recorded
him
among
the
company
of
the180
martyrs88
while
i
was
registered
among
those
whose
life
was
yet
to
be
preserved
and
accordingly
as
soon
as
i
awoke
and
found
myself
in
the
sea
the
providence
of
god
supplied
me
with
a
piece
of
timber
upon
which
i
placed
myself
and
the
waves
cast
me
upon
the
shore
of
an
island

first
lady
after
killing
the
serpent
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
walked
along
this
island
and
in
the
morning
i
saw
a
neck
of
land
bearing
the
marks
of
a
mans
feet
and
uniting
with
the
main
land
the
sun
having
now
risen
i
dried
my
clothes
in
its
rays
and
proceeded
along
the
path
that
i
had
discovered
until
i
drew
near
to
the
shore
upon
which
stands
the
city
when
i
beheld
a
snake
approaching
me
and
followed
by
a
serpent
which
was
endeavouring
to
destroy
it
the
tongue
of
the
snake
was181
hanging
from
its
mouth
in
consequence
of
excessive
fatigue
and
it
excited
my
compassion
so
i
took
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
the
head
of
the
serpent
which
instantly
died
the
snake
then
extended
a
pair
of
wings
and
soared
aloft
into
the
sky
leaving
me
in
wonder
at
the
sight
at
the
time
of
this
occurrence
i
had
become
so
fatigued
that
i
now
laid
myself
down
and
slept
but
i
awoke
after
a
little
while
and
found
a
damsel
seated
at
my
feet
and
gently
rubbing
them
with
her
hands
upon
which
i
immediately
sat
up
feeling
ashamed
that
she
should
perform
this
service
for
me
and
said
to
her
who
art
thou
and
what
dost
thou
wantâhow
soon
has
thou
forgotten
me
she
exclaimed
i
am
she
to
whom
thou
hast
just
done
a
kindness
by
killing
my
enemy
i
am
the
snake
whom
thou
savedst
from
the
serpent
for
i
am
a
jinneeyeh
and
the
serpent
was
a
jinnee
at
enmity
with
me
and
none
but
thou
delivered
me
from
him
therefore
as
soon
as
thou
didst
this
i
flew
to
the
ship
from
which
thy
sisters
cast
thee
and
transported
all
that
it
contained
to
thy
house
i
then
sunk
it
but
as
to
thy
sisters
i
transformed
them
by
enchantment
into
two
black
bitches
for
i
knew
all
that
they
had
done
to
thee
the
young
man
however
is
drownedâhaving
thus
said
she
took
me
up
and
placed
me
with
the
two
black
bitches
on
the
roof
of
my
house
and
i
found
all
the
treasures
that
the
ship
had
contained
collected
in
the
midst
of
my
house
nothing
was
lost
she
then
said
to
me
i
swear
by
that
which
was
engraved
upon
the
seal
of
suleymÃn
that
if
thou
do
not
inflict
three
hundred
lashes
upon
each
of
these
bitches
every
day
i
will
come
and
transform
thee
in
the
like
mannerâso
i
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
have
continued
ever
since
to
inflict
upon
them
these
stripes
though
pitying
them
while
i
do
so

the
khaleefeh
heard
this
story
with
astonishment
and
then
said
to
the
second
lady
and
what
occasioned
the
stripes
of
which
thou
bearest
the
marks
she
answered
as
followsâ

the
story
of
the
second
of
the
three
ladies
of
baghdÃd

o
prince
of
the
faithful
my
father
at
his
death
left
considerable
property
and
soon
after
that
event
i
married
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
of
the
age
who
when
i
had
lived
with
him
a
year
died
and
i182
inherited
from
him
eighty
thousand
pieces
of
gold
the
portion
that
fell
to
me
according
to
the
law89
with
part
of
which
i
made
for
myself
ten
suits
of
clothing
each
of
the
value
of
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
as
i
was
sitting
one
day
there
entered
my
apartment
an
old
woman
disgustingly
ugly
who
saluted
me
and
said
i
have
an
orphan
daughter
whose
marriage
i
am
to
celebrate
this
night
and
i
would
have
thee
obtain
a
reward
and
recompense
in
heaven
by
thy
being
present
at
her
nuptial
festivity
for
she
is
broken-hearted
having
none
to
befriend
her
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
she
then
wept
and
kissed
my
feet
and
being
moved
with
pity
and
compassion
i
assented
upon
which
she
desired
me
to
prepare
myself
telling
me
that
she
would
come
at
the
hour
of
nightfall
and
take
me
and
so
saying
she
kissed
my
hand
and
departed

i
arose
immediately
and
attired
myself
and
when
i
had
completed
my
preparations
the
old
woman
returned
saying
o
my
mistress
the
ladies
of
the
city
have
arrived
and
i
have
informed
them
of
thy
coming
and
they
are
waiting
with
joy
to
receive
theeâso
i
put
on
my
outer
garments
and
taking
my
female
slaves
with
me
proceeded
until
we
arrived
at
a
street
in
which
a
soft
wind
was
delightfully
playing
where
we
saw
a
gateway
over-arched
with
a
marble
vault
admirably
constructed
forming
the
entrance
to
a
palace
which
rose
from
the
earth
to
the
clouds90
on
our
arrival
there
the
old
woman
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
it
was
opened
we
entered
a
carpeted
passage
illuminated
by
lamps
and
candles
and
decorated
with
jewels
and
precious
metals91
through
this
passage
we
passed
into
a
saloon
of
unequalled
magnificence
furnished
with
mattresses
covered
with
silk
lighted
by
hanging
lamps
and
by
candles
and
having
at
its
upper
end
a
couch
of
alabaster
decorated
with
pearls
and
jewels
and
canopied
by
curtains
of
satin
from
which
there
came
forth
a
lady
beautiful
as
the
moon
who
exclaimed
to
me
most
welcome
art
thou
o
my
sister
thou
delightest
me
by
thy
company
and
refreshest
my
heart
she
then
sat
down
again
and
said
to
me
o
my
sister
i
have
a
brother
who
hath
seen
thee
at
a
festivity
he
is
a
young
man
more
handsome
than
myself
and
his
heart
being
violently
inflamed
with
love
of
thee
he
hath
bribed
this
old
woman
to
go
to
thee
and
to
employ
this
artifice
in
order
to
obtain
for
me
an
interview
with
thee
he
desireth
to
marry
thee
according
to
the
ordinance
of
god
and
his
apostle
and
in
that
which
is
lawful
there
is
no
disgraceâwhen
i
heard
these
words
and
saw
myself
thus
confined
in
the
house
so
that
i
could
not
escape
i
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
the
lady
re183joicing
at
my
consent
clapped
her
hands
and
opened
a
door
upon
which
there
came
out
from
it
a
young
man
so
surpassingly
handsome
that
my
heart
immediately
inclined
to
him
no
sooner
had
he
sat
down
than
the
áÃáee
and
four
witnesses
entered
and
saluted
us
and
proceeded
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
the
marriage-contract92
between
me
and
the
young
man
which
having
done
they
departed
and
when
they
had
retired
the
young
man
looked
towards
me
and
said
may
our
night
be
blessed
he
then
informed
me
that
he
desired
to
impose
a
covenant
upon
me
and
bringing
a
copy
of
the
áur-Ãn
said
swear
that
thou
wilt
not
indulge
a
preference
nor
at
all
incline
to
any
man
but
meâand
when
i
had
sworn
to
this
effect
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
embraced
me
and
the
love
of
him
took
entire
possession
of
my
heart

we
lived
together
in
the
utmost
happiness
for
the
space
of
a
month
after
which
i
begged
that
he
would
allow
me
to
go
to
the
bÃzÃr
in
order
to
purchase
some
stuffs
for
dress
and
having
obtained
his
permission
went
thither
in
company
with
the
old
woman
and
seated
myself
at
the
shop
of
a
young
merchant
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
and
whose
father
as
she
informed
me
had
died
and
left
him
great
wealth
she
desired
him
to
shew
me
his
most
costly
stuffs
and
while
he
was
occupied
in
doing
so
she
began
to
utter
various
flattering
expressions
in
praise
of
him
but
i
said
to
her
we
have
no
concern
with
the
praises
that
thou
bestowest
upon
him
we
desire
only
to
make
our
purchase
and
to
return
home
meanwhile
he
produced
to
us
what
we
wanted
and
we
handed
him
the
money
he
refused
however
to
take
it
saying
it
is
an
offering
of
hospitality
to
you
for
your
visit
this
dayâwhereupon
i
said
to
the
old
woman
if
he
will
not
take
the
money
return
to
him
his
stuff
but
he
would
not
receive
it
again
and
exclaimed
by
allah
i
will
take
nothing
from
you
all
this
is
a
present
from
me
for
a
single
kiss
which
i
shall
value
more
than
the
entire
contents
of
my
shopâwhat
will
a
kiss
profit
thee
asked
the
old
woman
then
turning
to
me
she
said
o
my
daughter
thou
hast
heard
what
the
youth
hath
said
no
harm
will
befall
thee
if
he
give
thee
a
kiss
and
thou
shalt
take
what
thou
wantestâdost
thou
not
know
said
i
that
i
have
taken
an
oath
she
answered
let
him
kiss
thee
then
without
thy
speaking
and
so
it
will
be
of
no
consequence
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
take
back
thy
money
thus
she
continued
to
palliate
the
matter
until
i
put
my
head
as
it
were
into
the
bag
and
consented
so
i
covered
my
eyes
and
held
the
edge
of
my
veil
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
the
pas184sengers
from
seeing
me
whereupon
he
put
his
mouth
to
my
cheek
beneath
the
veil
but
instead
of
merely
kissing
me
he
lacerated
my
cheek
by
a
violent
bite
i
fell
into
a
swoon
from
the
pain
and
the
old
woman
laid
me
on
her
lap
till
i
recovered
when
i
found
the
shop
closed
and
the
old
woman
uttering
expressions
of
grief
and
saying
what
god
hath
averted
would
have
been
a
greater
calamity
let
us
return
home
and
do
thou
feign
to
be
ill
and
i
will
come
to
thee
and
apply
a
remedy
that
shall
cure
the
wound
and
thou
wilt
quickly
be
restored

bÃzÃr
or
market-street
after
remaining
there
some
time
longer
i
rose
and
in
a
state
of
great
uneasiness
and
fear
returned
to
the
house
and
professed
myself
ill
upon
which
my
husband
came
in
to
me
and
said
what
hath185
befallen
thee
o
my
mistress
during
this
excursion
i
answered
i
am
not
wellâand
what
is
this
wound
said
he
that
is
upon
thy
cheek
and
in
the
soft
part
i
answered
when
i
asked
thy
permission
and
went
out
to-day
to
purchase
some
stuff
for
dress
a
camel
loaded
with
firewood
drove
against
me
in
the
crowd
and
tore
my
veil
and
wounded
my
cheek
as
thou
seest
for
the
streets
of
this
city
are
narrow93âto-morrow
then
he
exclaimed
i
will
go
to
the
governor
and
make
a
complaint
to
him
and
he
shall
hang
every
seller
of
firewood
in
the
cityâby
allah
said
i
burden
not
thyself
by
an
injury
to
any
one
for
the
truth
is
that
i
was
riding
upon
an
ass
which
took
fright
with
me
and
i
fell
upon
the
ground
and
a
stick
lacerated
my
cheekâif
it
be
so
then
he
replied
i
will
go
to-morrow
to
jaáºfar
el-barmekee
and
relate
the
matter
to
him
and
he
shall
kill
every
ass-driver
in
this
cityâwilt
thou
said
i
kill
all
those
men
on
my
account
when
this
which
befell
me
was
decreed
by
godâundoubtedly
he
answered
and
so
saying
he
seized
me
violently
and
then
sprang
up
and
uttered
a
loud
cry
upon
which
the
door
opened
and
there
came
forth
from
it
seven
black
slaves
who
dragged
me
from
my
bed
and
threw
me
down
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
whereupon
he
ordered
one
of
them
to
hold
me
by
my
shoulders
and
to
sit
upon
my
head
and
another
to
sit
upon
my
knees
and
to
hold
my
feet
a
third
then
came
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
said
o
my
lord
shall
i
strike
her
with
the
sword
and
cleave
her
in
twain
that
each
of
these
may
take
a
half
and
throw
it
into
the
tigris
for
the
fish
to
devour94
for
such
is
the
punishment
of
her
who
is
unfaithful
to
her
oath
and
to
the
laws
of
loveâmy
husband
answered
strike
her
o
saáºd95âand
the
slave
with
the
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
said
repeat
the
profession
of
the
faith
and
reflect
what
thou
wouldst
have
to
be
done
that
thou
mayest
give
thy
testamentary
directions
for
this
is
the
end
of
thy
lifeâgood
slave
i
replied
release
me
for
a
while
that
i
may
do
soâand
i
raised
my
head
and
weeping
as
i
spoke
addressed
my
husband
with
these
versesâ

you
render
me
lovelorn
and
remain
at
ease
you
make
my
wounded
eyelid
to
be
restless
and
you
sleep
your
abode
is
between
my
heart
and
my
eyes
and
my
heart
will
not
relinquish
you
nor
my
tears
conceal
my
passion
you
made
a
covenant
with
me
that
you
would
remain
faithful
but
when
you
had
gained
possession
of
my
heart
you
deceived
me
will
you
not
pity
my
love
for
you
and
my
moaning
have
you
yourself
been
secure
from
misfortunes
186
i
conjure
you
by
allah
if
i
die
that
you
write
upon
my
tombstone
this
was
a
slave
of
love
that
perchance
some
mourner
who
hath
felt
the
same
flame
may
pass
by
the
lovers
grave
and
pity
her96
but
on
hearing
these
verses
and
witnessing
my
weeping
he
became
more
incensed
and
replied
in
the
words
of
this
coupletâ

i
reject
not
the
beloved
of
my
heart
from
weariness
her
own
guilty
conduct
is
the
cause
of
her
punishment
she
desired
that
another
should
share
with
me
her
love
but
the
faith
of
my
heart
inclineth
not
to
partnership97
old
woman
interceding
for
the

lady
i
continued
to

endeavour

excite

compassion
saying
within
myself
i
will
humble
me
before
him

address
him
with
soft
words
that
he
may
at
least
refrain
from
killing
me
though
he
take
all
that
i
possessâbut
he
cried
out
to
the
slave
cleave
her
in
twain
for
she
is
no
longer
of
any
value
to
usâso
the
slave
approached
me
and
i
now
felt
assured
of
my
death
and
committed
myself
to
god
but
suddenly
the
old
woman
came
and
threw
herself
at
my
husbands
feet
and
kissing
them
exclaimed
o
my
son
by
the187
care
with
which
i
nursed
thee
i
conjure
thee
to
pardon
this
damsel
for
she
hath
committed
no
offence
that
deserveth
such
a
punishment
thou
art
young
and
i
fear
the
effect
of
the
imprecations
that
she
may
utter
against
theeâand
after
she
had
thus
addressed
him
she
wept
and
continued
to
importune
him
until
at
length
he
said
i
pardon
her
but
must
cause
her
to
bear
upon
her
person
such
marks
of
her
offence
as
shall
last
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
so
saying
he
commanded
the
slaves
to
strip
off
my
vest
and
taking
a
stick
cut
from
a
quince-tree
he
beat
me
upon
my
back
and
my
sides
until
i
became
insensible
from
the
violence
of
the
blows
and
despaired
of
my
life
he
then
ordered
the
slaves
to
take
me
away
as
soon
as
it
was
night
accompanied
by
the
old
woman
and
to
throw
me
into
my
house
in
which
i
formerly
resided
they
accordingly
executed
their
lords
commands
and
when
they
had
deposited
me
in
my
house
i
applied
myself
to
the
healing
of
my
wounds
but
after
i
had
cured
myself
my
sides
still
bore
the
appearance
of
having
been
beaten
with
miáraahs
i
continued
to
apply
remedies
for
four
months
before
i
was
restored
and
then
repaired
to
view
the
house
in
which
this
event
had
happened
but
i
found
it
reduced
to
ruin
and
the
whole
street
pulled
down
the
site
of
the
house
i
found
occupied
by
mounds
of
rubbish
and
i
knew
not
the
cause

under
these
circumstances
i
went
to
reside
with
this
my
sister
who
is
of
the
same
father
as
myself
and
i
found
with
her
these
two
bitches
having
saluted
her
i
informed
her
of
all
that
had
befallen
me
to
which
she
replied
who
is
secure
from
the
afflictions
of
fortune
praise
be
to
god
who
terminated
the
affair
with
safety

then
related
to
me
her
own
story
and
that
of
her
two
sisters
and
i
remained
with
her
and
neither
of

ever
mentioned

we
were
joined

conclusion

the
story
of
the
ladies

c

the
kaleefeh
was
astonished
at
this
story
and
ordered
it
to
be
recorded
in
a
book
as
an
authentic
history
and
deposited
the
book
in
his
library
and
he
said
to
the
first
lady
knowest
thou
where
the
jinneeyeh98
who
enchanted
thy
sisters
is
to
be
found
she
answered
o
prince
of
the
faithful
she
gave
me
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
said
when
thou
desirest
my
presence
burn
a
few
of
these
hairs
and
i
will188
be
with
thee
quickly
though
i
should
be
beyond
mount
áÃfâbring
then
the
hair
said
the
khaleefeh
the
lady
therefore
produced
it
and
the
khaleefeh
taking
it
burned
a
portion
of
it
and
when
the
odour
had
diffused
itself
the
palace
shook
and
they
heard
a
sound
of
thunder
and
lo
the
jinneeyeh
appeared
before
them
she
was
a
muslimeh
and
therefore
greeted
the
khaleefeh
by
saying
peace
be
on
thee
o
khaleefeh
of
godâto
which
he
replied
on
you
be
peace
and
the
mercy
of
god
and
his
blessings99âshe
then
said
know
that
this
lady
hath
conferred
on
me
a
benefit
for
which
i
am
unable
to
requite
her
for
she
rescued
me
from
death
by
killing
my
enemy
and
i
having
seen
what
her
sisters
had
done
to
her
determined
to
take
vengeance
upon
them
therefore
i
transformed
them
by
enchantment
into
two
bitches
and
indeed
i
had
wished
rather
to
kill
them
fearing
lest
they
should
trouble
her
but
now
if
thou
desire
their
restoration
o
prince
of
the
faithful
i
will
restore
them
as
a
favour
to
thee
and
to
her
for
i
am
one
of
the
true
believersâdo
so
said
the
khaleefeh
and
then
we
will
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
the
affair
of
the
lady
who
hath
been
beaten
and
examine
her
case
and
if
her
veracity
be
established
i
will
take
vengeance
for
her
upon
him
who
hath
oppressed
her
the
jinneeyeh
replied
o
prince
of
the
faithful
i
will
guide
thee
to
the
discovery
of
him
who
acted
thus
to
this
lady
and
oppressed
her
and
took
her
property
he
is
thy
nearest
relation
she
then
took
a
cup
of
water
and
having
pronounced
a
spell
over
it
sprinkled
the
faces
of
the
two
bitches
saying
be
restored
to
your
original
human
formsâwhereupon
they
became
again
two
young
ladiesâextolled
be
the
perfection

done

the
jinneeyeh

who
beat
the
lady
is
thy
son
el-emeen
who
had
heard
of
her
beauty
and
lovelinessâand
she
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
happened
the
khaleefeh
was
astonished
and
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
for
the
restoration
of
these
two
bitches
which
hath
been
effected
through
my
meansâand
immediately
he
summoned
before
him
his
son
el-emeen
and
inquired
of
him
the
history
of
the
lady
and
he
related
to
him
the
truth
he
then
sent
for
áÃáees
and
witnesses
and
the
first
lady
and
her
two
sisters
who
had
been
transformed
into
bitches
he
married
to
the
three
mendicants
who
had
related
that
they
were
the
sons
of
kings
and
these
he
made
chamberlains
of
his

appointing
them
all
that
they
required
and
allotting
them

restored

her
a

took
as
his

admitted
her

appointed
her
a

herself

it
conceals

that
the
kind

arab

those
of

wahhÃbees
wearing
veils
of
this
kind
composed
of
printed
muslin
completely
concealing
their
features
yet
of
sufficiently
loose
fabric
to
admit
of
their
seeing
their
way

the
more
common
kind
of
arab
face-veil
is
a
long
strip
of
white
muslin
or
of
a
kind
of
black
crape
covering
the
whole
of
the
face
excepting
the
eyes

reaching
nearly

it
is
suspended
at
the
top
by
a
narrow
band

passes
up
the
forehead

which
is
sewed
as
are
also
the
two
upper
corners
of
the
veil
to
a
band
that
is
tied
round
the

veil
is
called

black
kind

often
ornamented

think

charged
by
the

when
he
beheld
them
resembling
in

two
huge

suspended
upside-down
with
irons
attached
to
their
necks

knees
he
could
not
refrain
from
uttering

the
two

became

violently
agitated

broke

objectionable
scene
which
it
is
to
be

convey
a
very
erroneous
idea

of
arab
ladies
though
i
have
witnessed
at
private
festivities
in
cairo
abominable
scenes
of
which
ladies
screened
behind
lattices
were
spectators
can
the
same
be
said
with
respect
to
the
previous
carousal
this
is
a
question
which
cannot
be
answered
in
a
few
words

the
prohibition
of
wine
or
rather
of
fermented
and
intoxicating
liquors
being
one
194of
the
most
remarkable
and
important
points
of
the
mohammadan
religion
it
might
be
imagined
that
the
frequent
stories
in
this
work
describing
parties
of
muslims
as
habitually
indulging
in
the
use
of
forbidden
beverages
are
scandalous
misrepresentations
of
arab
manners
and
customs
there
are
however
many
similar
anecdotes
interspersed
in
the
works
of
arab
historians
which
though
many
of
them
are
probably
untrue
in
their
application
to
particular
individuals
could
not
have
been
offered
to
the
public
by
such
writers
if
they
were
not
of
a
nature
consistent
with
the
customs
of
a
considerable
class
of
the
arab
nation

in
investigating
this
subject
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
state
that
there
is
a
kind
of
wine
which
muslims
are
permitted
to
drink
it
is
properly
called
nebeedh
a
name
which
is
now
given
to
prohibited
kinds
of
wine
and
is
generally
prepared
by
putting
dry
grapes
or
dry
dates
in
water
to
extract
their
sweetness
and
suffering
the
liquor
to
ferment
slightly
until
it
acquires
a
little
sharpness
or
pungency
the
prophet
himself
was
in
the
habit
of
drinking
wine
of
this
kind
which
was
prepared
for
him
in
the
first
part
of
the
night
he
drank
it
on
the
first
and
second
days
following
but
if
any
remained
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
he
either
gave
it
to
his
servants
or
ordered
it
to
be
poured
out
upon
the
ground178
such
beverages
have
therefore
been
drunk
by
the
strictest
of
his
followers
and
ibn-khaldoon
strongly
argues
that
nebeedh
thus
prepared
from
dates
was
the
kind
of
wine
used
by
the
khaleefehs
hÃroon
er-rasheed
and
el-ma-moon
and
several
other
eminent
men
who
have
been
commonly
accused
of
habitually
and
publicly
indulging
in
debauches
of
wine
properly
so
called
that
is
of
inebriating
liquors179

nebeedh
prepared
from
raisins
is
commonly
sold
in
arab
towns
under
the
name
of
zebeeb
which
signifies
raisins
this
i
have
often
drunk
in
cairo
but
never
could
perceive
that
it
was
in
the
slightest
degree
fermented
other
beverages
to
which
the
name
of
nebeedh
has
been
applied
though
like
zebeeb
no
longer
called
by
that
name
are
also
sold
in
arab
towns
the
most
common
of
these
is
an
infusion
of
licorice
and
called
by
the
name
of
the
root
erá-soos
the
nebeedh
of
dates
is
sold
in
cairo
with
the
dates
themselves
in
the
liquor
and
in
like
manner
is
that
of
figs
under
the
same
appellation
of
nebeedh
have
been
classed

different
kinds
of
beer
now
commonly
called
boozeh

have
been
mentioned
in
former
pages
opium

are
now
more
frequently
used
by
the
muslims
to
induce
intoxication
or
exhilaration

generally
used
alone
or
mixed
with

for
smoking
and
the
capsules
without
the

enter
into
the
composition
of
several
intoxicating
conserves
some
remarks
upon
this
subject
have
been
inserted
in
a
former
note

by
my
own
experience
i
am
but
little
qualified
to
pronounce
an
opinion
respecting
the
prevalence
of
drinking
wine
among
the
arabs
for
never
drinking
it
myself
i
had
little
opportunity
of
observing
others
do
so
during
my
residence
among
muslims
i
judge
therefore
from
the
conversations
and
writings
of
arabs
which
justify
me
in
asserting
that
the
practice
of
drinking
wine
in
private
and
by
select
parties
is
far
from
being
uncommon
among
modern
muslims
though
certainly
more
so
than
it
was
before
the
introduction
of
tobacco
into
the
east
in
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
of
our
era
for
this
herb
being
in
a
slight
degree
exhilarating
and
at
the
same
time
soothing
and
unattended
by
the
injurious
effects
that
result
from
wine
is
a
sufficient
luxury
to
many
who
without
it
would
have
recourse
to
intoxicating
beverages
merely
to
pass
away
hours
of
idleness
the
use
of
coffee
too
which
became
common
in
egypt
syria
and
other
countries
besides
arabia
a
century
earlier
than
tobacco
doubtless
tended
to
render
the
habit
of
drinking
wine
less
general
that
it
was
adopted
as
a
substitute
for
wine
appears
even
from
its
name
áahweh
an
old
arabic
term
for
wine
whence
the
turkish
áahveh
the
italian
caffe
and
our

there
is
an
arabic
work
of
some
celebrity
and
not
of
small
extent
entitled
áalbet
el-kumeyt180
apparently
written
shortly
before
the
arabs
were
in
possession
of
the
first
of
the
above-mentioned
substitutes
for
wine
nearly
the
whole
of
which
consists
of
anecdotes
and
verses
relating
to
the
pleasures
resulting
from
or
attendant
upon
the
use
of
wine
a
few
pages
at
the
end
being
devoted
to
the
condemnation
of
this
practice
or
in
other
words
to
prove
the
worthlessness
of
all
that
precedes
of
this
work
i
possess
a
copy
a
quarto
volume
of
464
pages
i
have
endeavoured
to
skim
its
cream
but
found
it
impossible
to
do
so
without
collecting
at
the
same
time
a
considerable
quantity
of
most
filthy
scum
for
it
is
characterised
by
wit
and
humour
plentifully
interlarded
with
the
grossest
and
most
revolting
obscenity
yet
it
serves
to
confirm
what
has
been
above
asserted
the
mere
existence
of
such
a
work
and
it
is
not
the
only
one
of
the
kind
written
by
a
man
of
learning
and
i
believe
a
áÃáee
a
judge
or
one
holding
the
honourable
office
of
a
guardian
of
religion
and
morality181âwritten
too
evidently
with
pleasure
notwithstanding
his
assertion
to
the
contraryâis
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
the
prevalence
of
the
practice
which
it
paints
in
the
most
fascinating
colours
and
then
condemns
its
author
terminates
a
chapter
the
ninth
in
which
many
well-known
persons
are
mentioned
as
having
been
addicted
to
wine
by
saying
that
the
khaleefehs
emeers
and
wezeers
so
addicted
are
too
numerous
to
name
in
such
a
work
and
by
relating
a
story
of
a
man
who
placed
his
own
wife
in
pledge
in
the
hands
of
a
wine-merchant
after
having
expended
in
the
purchase
of
the
forbidden
liquor
all
the
property
that
he
possessed
he
excuses
himself
in
his
preface
for
writing
this
book
by
saying
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
so
by
one
whom
he
could
not
disobey
thus
giving
us
a
pretty
strong
proof
that
a
great
man
in
his
time
was
not
ashamed
of
avowing
his
fondness
for
the
prohibited
enjoyment
if
then
we
admit
the
respectable
authority
of
ibn-khaldoon
and
acquit
of
the
vice
of
drunkenness
those
illustrious
individuals
whose
characters
he
vindicates
we
must
still
regard
most
of
the
anecdotes
relating
to
the
carousals
of
other
persons
as
being
not
without
foundation

one
of
my
friends
who
enjoys
a
high
reputation
ranking
among
the
most
distinguished
of
the
ulamÃ

of
cairo
is
well
known
to
his
intimate
acquaintances
as
frequently
indulging
in
the
use
of
forbidden
beverages
with
a
few
select
associates
i
disturbed
him
and
his
companions
by
an
evening
visit
on
one
of
these
occasions
and
was
kept
waiting
within
the
street-door
while
the
guests
quickly
removed
everything
that
would
give
me
any
indication
of
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
employed
for
the
announcement
of
my
assumed
name
and
their
knowledge
of
my
abstemious
character
completely
disconcerted
them
i
found
them
however
in
the
best
humour
they
had
contrived
it
appeared
to
fill
with
wine
a
china
bottle
of
the
kind
used
at
that
season
winter
for
water
and
when
any
one
of
them
asked
the
servant
for
water
this
bottle
was
brought
to
him
but
when
i
made
the
same
demand
my
host
told
me
that
there
was
a
bottle
of
water
on
the
sill
of
the
window
behind
that
part
of
the
deewÃn
upon
which
i
was
seated
the
evening
passed
away
very
pleasantly
and
i
should
not
have
known
how
unwelcome
was
my
intrusion
had
not
one
of
the
guests
with
whom
i
was
intimately
acquainted
in
walking
part
of
the
way
home
with
me
explained
to
me
the
whole
occurrence
there
was
with
us
a
third
person
who
thinking
that
my
antipathy
to
wine
was
feigned
asked
me
to
stop
at
his
house
on
my
way
and
take
a
cup
of
white
coffee
by
which
he
meant
brandy

another
of
my
muslim
acquaintances
in
cairo
i
frequently
met
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
where
though
he
was
in
most
respects
very
bigoted
he
was
in
the
habit
of
indulging
in
wine
for
some
time
he
refrained
from
this
gratification
when
i
was
196
present
but
at
length
my
presence
became
so
irksome
to
him
that
he
ventured
to
enter
into
an
argument
with
me
on
the
subject
of
the
prohibition
the
only
answer
i
could
give
to
his
question
why
is
wine
forbiddenâwas
in
the
words
of
the
áur-Ãn
because
it
is
the
source
of
more
evil
than
profit182
this
suited
his
purpose
as
i
intended
it
should
and
he
asked
what
evil
results
from
it
i
answered
intoxication
and
quarrels
câthen
said
he
if
a
man
take
not
enough
to
intoxicate
him
there
is
no
harmâand
finding
that
i
acquiesced
by
silence
he
added
i
am
in
the
habit
of
taking
a
little
but
never
enough
to
intoxicate

me

of
inebriating
liquors

histories
tell
us
that
some
of
the
early
followers
of
the
prophet
indulged
in
wine
holding
the
text
above
referred
to
as
indecisive
and
that
moáammad
was
at
first
doubtful
upon
this
subject
appears
from
another
text
in
which
his
followers
were
told
not
to
come
to
prayer
when
they
were
drunk
until
they
should
know
what
they
would
say183
an
injunction
somewhat
similar
to
one
in
the
bible184
but
when
frequent
and
severe
contentions
resulted
from
their
use
of
wine
the
following
more
decided
condemnation
of
the
practice
was
pronouncedâo
ye
who
have
become
believers
verily
wine
and
lots
and
images
and
divining-arrows
are
an
abomination
of
the
work
of
the
devil
therefore
avoid
them
that
ye
may
prosper185
this
law
is
absolute
its
violation
in
the
smallest
degree
is
criminal
the
punishment
ordained
by
the
law
for
drinking
or
according
to
most
doctors
for
even
tasting
wine
or
spirits
or
inducing
intoxication
by
any
other
means
on
ordinary
occasions
is
the
infliction
of
eighty
stripes
in
the
case
of
a
free
man
and
forty
in
that
of
a
slave
but
if
the
crime
be
openly
committed
in
the
course
of
any
day
of
the
month
of
ramaáÃn
when
others
are
fasting
the
punishment
prescribed
is
death

the
prohibition
of
wine
hindered
many
of
the
prophets
contemporaries
from
embracing
his
religion
it
is
said
that
the
famous
poet
el-aáºshÃ

who
was
one
of
them
delayed
to
join
his
cause
on
this
account
until
death
prevented
him
a
person
passing
by
his
tomb
at
menfooáÃh
in
el-yemÃmeh
and
observing
that
it
was
moist
asked
the
reason
and
was
answered
that
the
young
men
of
the
place
considering
him
still
as
their
cup-companion
drank
wine
over
his
grave
and
poured
his
cup
upon
it186
yet
many
of
the
most
respectable
of
the
pagan
arabs
like
certain
of
the
jews
and
early
christians
abstained
totally
from
wine
from
a
feeling
of
its
injurious
effects
upon
morals
and
in
their
climate
upon
health
or
more
especially
from
the
fear
of
being
led
by
it
into
the
commission
of
foolish
and
degrading
actions
thus
áeys
the
son
of
Ãáim
being
one
night
overcome
with
wine
attempted
to
grasp
the
moon
and
swore
that
he
would
not
quit
the
spot
where
he
stood
until
he
had
laid
hold
of
it
after
leaping
several
times
with
the
view
of
doing
so
he
fell
flat
upon
his
face
and
when
he
recovered
his
senses
and
was
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
face
being
bruised
he
made
a
solemn
vow
to
abstain
from
wine
ever
after187
a
similar
feeling
operated
upon
many
muslims
more
than
religious
principle
the
khaleefeh
abd-el-melik
ibn-marwÃn
took
pleasure
in
the
company
of
a
slave
named
naáeeb
and
one
day
desired
him
to
drink
with
him
the
slave
replied
o
prince
of
the
faithful
i
am
not
related
to
thee
nor
have
i
any
authority
over
thee
and
i
am
of
no
rank
or
lineage
i
am
a
black
slave
and
my
wit
and
politeness
have
drawn
me
into
thy
favour
how
then
shall
i
take
that
which
will
plunder
me
of
these
two
qualities
and
by
what
shall
i
then
propitiate
thee
the
khaleefeh
admired
and
excused
him188

it
was
the
custom
of
many
muslim
princes
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
above
anecdote
to
admit
the
meanest
of
their
dependants
to
participate
in
their
unlawful
carousals
when
they
could
have
no
better
companions
but
poets
and
musicians
were
197
their
more
common
associates
on
these
occasions
and
these
two
classes
and
especially
the
latter
are
in
the
present
day
the
most
addicted
to
intoxicating
liquors
few
modern
arab
musicians
are
so
well
contented
with
extraordinary
payment
and
mere
sweet
sherbet
as
with
a
moderate
fee
and
plenty
of
wine
and
brandy
and
many
of
them
deem
even
wine
but
a
sorry
beverage

it
was
usual
with
the
host
and
guests
at
wine-parties
to
wear
dresses
of
bright
colours
red
yellow
and
green189
and
to
perfume
their
beards
and
mustaches
with
civet
or
to
have
rose-water
sprinkled
upon
them
and
ambergris
or
aloes-wood
or
some
other
odoriferous
substance
placed
upon
burning
coals
in
a
censer
diffused
a
delicious
fragrance
throughout
the
saloon
of
the
revels

the
wine
it
appears
was
rather
thick
for
it
was
necessary
to
strain
it190
it
was
probably
sweet
and
not
strong
for
it
was
drunk
in
large
quantities
frequently
perhaps
it
was
nebeedh
of
dry
raisins
kept
longer
than
the
law
allows
it
was
usually
kept
in
a
large
earthen
vessel
called
denn
high
and
small
at
the
bottom
which
was
partly
imbedded
in
the
earth
to
keep
it
upright
the
name
of
this
vessel
is
now
given
to
a
cask
of
wood
but
the
kind
above
mentioned
was
of
earth
for
it
was
easily
brokenâa
famous
saint
abu-l-áoseyn
en-nooree
seeing
a
vessel
on
the
tigris
containing
thirty
denns
belonging
to
the
khaleefeh
el-moáºtaáid
and
being
told
that
they
contained
wine
took
a
boat-pole
and
broke
them
all
excepting
one
when
brought
before
the
khaleefeh
to
answer
for
this
action
and
asked
by
him
who
made
thee
moátesib191
he
boldly
answered
he
who
made
thee
khaleefehâand
was
pardoned192âpitch
was
used
by
the
arabs
as
it
was
by
the
greeks
and
romans
for
the
purpose
of
curing
their
wine
the
interior
of
the
denn
being
coated
with
it
a
smaller
kind
of
earthen
jar
or
amphora193
and
a
bottle
of
leather194
or
of
glass195
were
also
used
the
wine
was
transferred
for
the
table
to
glass
jugs
or
long-spouted
ewers196
these
and
the
cups
were
placed
upon
a
round
embroidered
cloth
spread
on
the
floor
or
upon
a
round
tray
the
latter
now
is
in
general
use
and
is
supported
on
a
low
stool
described
in
a
former
note
as
being
used
at
ordinary
meals
the
guests
sat
around
reclining
against
pillars
or
they
sat
upon
the
deewÃn
and
a
page
or
slave
handed
the
cup
having
on
his
right
arm
a
richly-embroidered
napkin
the
person
after
drinking
took
the
end
of
this
to
wipe
his
lips
the
cups
are
often
described
as
holding
a
fluid
pound
or
little
less
than
an
english
pint
and
this
is
to
be
understood
literally
or
nearly
so
they
were
commonly
of
cut
glass
but
some
were
of
crystal
or
silver
or
gold197
with
these
and
the
ewers
or
jugs
were
placed
several
saucers
or
small
dishes198
of
fresh
and
dried
fruits199
and
fans
and
fly-whisks
of
the
kinds
described
on
a
former
occasion
were
used
by
the
guests

the
most
common
and
esteemed
fruits
in
the
countries
inhabited
by
the
arabs
may
here
be
mentioned

the
date200
deserves
the
first
place
the
prophets
favourite
fruits
were
fresh
dates201
and
water-melons
and
he
ate
them
both
together202
honour
said
he
your
paternal
aunt
the
date-palm
for
she
was
created
of
the
earth
of
which
adam
was
formed203
it
is
said
that
god
hath
given
this
tree
as
a
peculiar
favour
to
the
198muslims
that
he
hath
decreed
all
the
date-palms
in
the
world
to
them
and
they
have
accordingly
conquered
every
country
in
which
these
trees
are
found
and
all
are
said
to
have
derived
their
origin
from
the
hejÃz204
the
palm-tree
has
several
well-known
properties
that
render
it
an
emblem
of
a
human
being
among
which
are
these
that
if
the
head
be
cut
off
the
tree
dies
and
if
a
branch
be
cut
off
another
does
not
grow
in
its
place205
dates
are
preserved
in
a
moist
state
by
being
merely
pressed
together
in
a
basket
or
skin
and
thus
prepared
are
called
ajweh
there
are
many
varieties
of
this
fruit
the
pith
or
heart
of
the
palm206
is
esteemed
for
its
delicate
flavour

the
water-melon207
from
what
has
been
said
of
it
above
ought
to
be
ranked
next
and
it
really
merits
this
distinction
whoso
eateth
said
the
prophet
a
mouthful
of
water-melon
god
writeth
for
him
a
thousand
good
works
and
cancelleth
a
thousand
evil
works
and
raiseth
him
a
thousand
degrees
for
it
came
from
paradiseâand
again
the
water-melon
is
food
and
drink
acid
and
alkali
and
a
support
of
life
c208
the
varieties
of
this
fruit
are
very
numerous

the
banana209
is
a
delicious
fruit
the
prophet
pronounced
the
banana-tree
to
be
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
resembles
a
thing
in
paradise
because
it
bears
fruit
both
in
winter
and
summer210

the
pomegranate211
is
another
celebrated
fruit
every
pomegranate
according
to
the
prophet
contains
a
fecundating
seed
from
paradise212

the
other
most
common
and
esteemed
fruits
are
the
followingâthe
apple
pear
quince
apricot
peach
fig
sycamore-fig
grape
lote
jujube
plum
walnut
almond
hazel-nut
pistachio-nut
orange
seville-orange
lime
and
lemon
citron
mulberry
olive
and
sugar-cane213

of
a
selection
of
these
fruits
consists
the
dessert
which
accompanies
the
wine
but
the
table
is
not
complete
without
a
bunch
or
two
of
flowers
placed
in
the
midst

though
the
arabs
are
far
from
being
remarkable
for
exhibiting
taste
in
the
planning
of
their
gardens
they
are
passionately
fond
of
flowers
and
especially
of
the
rose214âthe
khaleefeh
el-mutawekkil
monopolized
roses
for
his
own
enjoyment
saying
i
am
the
king
of
suláÃns
and
the
rose
is
the
king
of
sweet-scented
flowers
therefore
each
of
us
is
most
worthy
of
the
other
for
a
companion
the
rose
in
his
time
was
seen
nowhere
but
in
his
palace
during
the
season
of
this
flower
he
wore
rose-coloured
clothes
and
his
carpets
c
were
sprinkled
with
rose-water215
a
similar
passion
for
the
rose
is
said
to
have
distinguished
a
weaver
in
the
reign
of
el-ma-moon
he
was
constantly
employed
at
his
loom
every
day
of
the
year
even
during
the
congregational
prayers
of
friday
excepting
in
the
rose-season
when
he
abandoned
his
work
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
wine
early
in
the
morning
and
late
in
the
evening
loudly
proclaiming
his
revels
by
singingâ

the
season
has
become
pleasant
the
time
of
the
rose
has
come
take
your
morning
potations
as
long
as
the
rose
has
blossoms
and
flowers
when
he
resumed
his
work
he
made
it
known
by
singing
aloudâ

if
my
lord
prolong
my
life
until
the
rose-season
i
will
take
again
my
morning
potations
but
if
i
die
before
it
alas
for
the
loss
of
the
rose
and
wine
i
implore
the
god
of
the
supreme
throne
whose
glory
be
extolled
that
my
heart
may
continually
enjoy
the
evening
potations
to
the
day
of
resurrection
199

âthe
khaleefeh
was
so
amused
with
the
humour
of
this
man
that
he
granted
him
an
annual
pension
of
ten
thousand
dirhems
to
enable
him
to
enjoy
himself
amply
on
these
occasions216âanother
anecdote
may
be
added
to
shew
the
estimation
of
the
rose
in
the
mind
of
an
arab
it
is
said
that
rowá
ibn-áÃtim
the
governor
of
the
province
of
northern
africa
was
sitting
one
day
with
a
female
slave
in
an
apartment
of
his
palace
when
a
eunuch
brought
him
a
jar
full
of
red
and
white
roses
which
a
man
had
offered
as
a
present
he
ordered
the
eunuch
to
fill
the
jar
with
silver
in
return
but
his
concubine
said
o
my
lord
thou
hast
not
acted
equitably
towards
the
man
for
his
present
to
thee
is
of
two
colours
red
and
white
the
emeer
replied
thou
hast
said
truly
and
gave
orders
to
fill
the
jar
for
him
with
silver
and
gold
dirhems
and
deenÃrs
intermixed217âsome
persons
preserve
roses
during
the
whole
of
the
year
in
the
following
manner
they
take
a
number
of
rose-buds
and
fill
with
them
a
new
earthen
jar
and
after
closing
its
mouth
with
mud
so
as
to
render
it
impervious
to
the
air
bury
it
in
the
earth
whenever
they
want
a
few
roses
they
take
out
some
of
these
buds
which
they
find
unaltered
sprinkle
a
little
water
upon
them
and
leave
them
for
a
short
time
in
the
air
when
they
open
and
appear
as
if
just
gathered218âthe
rose
is
even
a
subject
of
miracles
it
is
related
by
ibn-áuteybeh
that
there
grows
in
india
a
kind
of
rose
upon
the
leaves
of
which
is
inscribed
there
is
no
deity
but
god219
but
i
find
a
more
particular
account
of
this
miraculous
rose
a
person
who
professed
to
have
seen
it
said
i
went
into
india
and
i
saw
at
one
of
its
towns
a
large
rose
sweet-scented
upon
which
was
inscribed
in
white
characters
there
is
no
deity
but
god
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
aboo-bekr
is
the
very
veracious
omar
is
the
discriminator
and
i
doubted
of
this
whether
it
had
been
done
by
art
so
i
took
one
of
the
blossoms
not
yet
opened
and
in
it
was
the
same
inscription
and
there
were
many
of
the
same
kind
there
the
people
of
that
place
worshipped
stones
and
knew
not
god
to
whom
be
ascribed
might
and
glory220âroses
are
announced
for
sale
in
the
streets
of
cairo
by
the
cry
of
the
rose
was
a
thorn
from
the
sweat
of
the
prophet
it
blossomed
in
allusion
to
a
miracle
recorded
of
moáammad
when
i
was
taken
up
into
heaven
said
the
prophet
some
of
my
sweat
fell
upon
the
earth
and
from
it
sprang
the
rose
and
whoever
would
smell
my
scent
let
him
smell
the
rose
in
another
tradition
it
is
said
the
white
rose
was
created
from
my
sweat
on
the
night
of
the
meáºrÃj221
and
the
red
rose
from
the
sweat
of
jebraeel222
and
the
yellow
rose
from
the
sweat
of
el-burÃá223âthe
persians
take
especial
delight
in
roses
sometimes
spreading
them
as
carpets
or
beds
on
which
to
sit
or
recline
in
their
revellings

but
there
is
a
flower
pronounced
more
excellent
than
the
rose
that
of
the
egyptian
privet
or
lawsonia
inermis224
moáammad
said
the
chief
of
the
sweet-scented
flowers
of
this
world
and
of
the
next
is
the
fÃghiyeh
and
this
was
his
favourite
flower225
i
approve
of
his
taste
for
this
flower
which
grows
in
clusters
somewhat
like
those
of
the
lilac
has
a
most
delicious
fragrance
but
on
account
of
discrepancies
in
different
traditions
a
muslim
may
with
a
clear
conscience
prefer
either
of
the
two
flowers
next
mentioned

the
prophet
said
of
the
violet226
the
excellence
of
the
extract
of
violets
above
all
other
extracts
is
as
the
excellence
of
me
above
all
the
rest
of
the
creation
it
is
cold
in
summer
and
hot
in
winter
and
in
another
tradition
the
excellence
of
the
violet
is
as
the
excellence
of
el-islÃm
above
all
other
religions227
a
delicious
sherbet
is
made
of
a
conserve
of
sugar
and

the
myrtle228
is
the
rival
of
the
violet
adam
said
the
prophet
fell
down
from
paradise
with
three
things
the
myrtle
which
is
the
chief
of
sweet-scented
flowers
in
this
world
an
ear
of
wheat
which
is
the
chief
of
all
kinds
of
food
in
this
world
and
pressed
dates
which
are
the
chief
of
the
fruits
of
this
world229

the
anemone230
was
monopolized
for
his
own
enjoyment
by
noáºmÃn
ibn-el-mundhir
king
of
el-áeereh
and
contemporary
of
moáammad
as
the
rose
was
afterwards
by
el-mutawekkil231

another
flower
much
admired
and
celebrated
in
the
east
is
the
gilliflower232
there
are
three
principal
kinds
the
most
esteemed
is
the
yellow
or
golden-coloured
which
has
a
delicious
scent
both
by
night
and
day

toper
who
had
nothing
it

wine
to
enjoy
exclaimedâ

ho
give

wine

this

music
was
condemned
by
the
prophet
almost
as
severely
as
wine
singing
and
hearing
songs
said
he
cause
hypocrisy
to
grow
in
the
heart
like
as
water
promoteth
the
growth
of

musical
instruments

powerful
means

which
the

seduces

an
instrument

the
devils
muÃddin
serving
to
call
men
to
his
worship
as
stated
in
a
former
note
of
the
hypocrisy
of
those
attached
to
music
the
following
anecdote
presents
an
instanceâa
drunken
young
man
with
a
lute
in
his
hand
was
brought
one
night
before
the
khaleefeh
abd-el-melik
the
son
of
marwÃn
who
pointing
to
the
instrument
asked
what
it
was
and
what
was
its
use
the
youth
made
no
answer
so
he
asked
those
around
him
but
they
also
remained
silent
till
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
said
o
prince
of
the
201faithful
this
is
a
lute
it
is
made
by
taking
some
wood
of
the
pistachio-tree
and
cutting
it
into
thin
pieces
and
glueing
these
together
and
then
attaching
over
them
these
chords
which
when
a
beautiful
girl
touches
them
send
forth
sounds
more
pleasant
than
those
of
rain
falling
upon
a
desert
land
and
my
wife
is
separated
from
me
by
a
triple
divorce
if
every
one
in
this
council
is
not
acquainted
with
it
and
doth
not
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
and
thou
the
first
of
them
o
prince
of
the
faithful
the
khaleefeh
laughed
and
ordered
that
the
young
man
should
be
discharged241

the
latter
saying
of
the
prophet
respecting
the
devil
suggests
to
me
the
insertion
of
another
anecdote
related
of
himself
by
ibrÃheem
el-mÃáilee
the
father
of
is-áÃá
both
of
whom
were
very
celebrated
musicians
i
give
a
translation
of
it
somewhat
abridgedâi
asked
er-rasheed
says
ibrÃheem
to
grant
me
permission
to
spend
a
day
at
home
with
my
female
slaves
and
brothers
and
he
gave
me
two
thousand
deenÃrs
and
appointed
the
next
saturday
for
this
purpose
i
caused
the
meats
and
wine
and
other
necessaries
to
be
prepared
and
ordered
the
chamberlain
to
close
the
door
and
admit
no
one
but
while
i
was
sitting
with
my
attendants
standing
in
the
form
of
a
curved
line
before
me
there
entered
and
approached
me
a
sheykh
reverend
and
dignified
and
comely
in
appearance
wearing
short
khuffs242
and
two
soft
gowns
with
a
áalensuweh243
upon
his
head
and
in
his
hand
a
silver-headed
staff
and
sweet
odours
were
diffused
from
his
clothes
i
was
enraged
with
the
chamberlain
for
admitting
him
but
on
his
saluting
me
in
a
very
courteous
manner
i
returned
his
salutation
and
desired
him
to
sit
down
he
then
began
to
repeat
to
me
stories
tales
of
war
and
poetry
so
that
my
anger
was
appeased
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
my
servants
had
not
presumed
to
admit
him
until
acquainted
with
his
politeness
and
courteousness
i
therefore
said
to
him
hast
thou
any
inclination
for
meat
he
answered
i
have
no
want
of
itâand
the
wine
said
i
he
replied
yes
so
i
drank
a
large
cupful
and
he
did
the
same
and
then
said
to
me
o
ibrÃheem
wilt
thou
let
us
hear
some
specimen
of
thy
art
in
which
thou
hast
excelled
the
people
of
thy
profession
i
was
angry
at
his
words
but
i
made
light
of
the
matter
and
having
taken
the
lute
and
tuned
it
i
played
and
sang
whereupon
he
said
thou
hast
performed
well
o
ibrÃheem
i
became
more
enraged
and
said
within
myself
he
is
not
content
with
coming
hither
without
permission
and
asking
me
to
sing
but
he
calls
me
by
my
name
and
proves
himself
unworthy
of
my
conversation
he
then
said
wilt
thou
let
us
hear
more
if
so
we
will
requite
thee
and
i
took
the
lute
and
sang
using
my
utmost
care
on
account
of
his
saying
we
will
requite
thee
he
was
moved
with
delight
and
said
thou
hast
performed
well
o
my
master
ibrÃheemâadding
wilt
thou
permit
thy
slave
to
sing
i
answered
as
thou
pleasestâbut
thinking
lightly
of
his
sense
to
sing
after
me
he
took
the
lute
and
tuned
it
and
by
allah
i
imagined
that
the
lute
spoke
in
his
hands
with
an
eloquent
arab
tongue
he
proceeded
to
sing
some
verses
commencingâ

my
heart
is
wounded
who
will
give
me
for
it
a
heart
without
a
wound
the
narrator
continues
by
saying
that
he
was
struck
dumb
and
motionless
with
ecstasy
and
that
the
strange
sheykh
after
having
played
and
sung
again
and
taught
him
an
enchanting
air
with
which
he
afterwards
enraptured
his
patron
the
khaleefeh
vanished
ibrÃheem
in
alarm
seized
his
sword
and
was
the
more
amazed
when
he
found
that
the
porter
had
not
seen
the
stranger
enter
or
leave
the
house
but
he
heard
his
voice
again
outside
telling
him
that
he
was
aboo-murrah
the
devil244âtwo
other
anecdotes
of
a
similar
kind
are
related
in
the
work
from
which
the
above
is
taken

ibrÃheem
el-mÃáilee
his
son
is-áÃá
and
mukhÃriá
a
pupil
of
the
former
were
202especially
celebrated
among
the
arab
musicians
and
among
the
distinguished
men
of
the
reign
of
hÃroon
er-rasheed
is-áÃá
el-mÃáilee
relates
of
his
father
ibrÃheem
that
when
er-rasheed
took
him
into
his
service
he
gave
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dirhems
and
allotted
him
a
monthly
pension
of
ten
thousand
dirhems
besides
occasional
presents
one
of
which
is
mentioned
as
amounting
to
a
hundred
thousand
dirhems
for
a
single
song
and
the
produce
of
his
ibrÃheems
farms
he
had
food
constantly
prepared
for
him
three
sheep
every
day
for
his
kitchen
besides
birds
three
thousand
dirhems
were
allowed
him
for
fruits
perfumes
c
every
month
and
a
thousand
dirhems
for
his
clothing
and
with
all
this
says
his
son
he
died
without
leaving
more
than
three
thousand
deenÃrs
a
sum
not
equal
to
his
debts
which
i
paid
after
his
death245âibrÃheem
was
of
persian
origin
and
of
a
high
family
he
was
commonly
called
the
nedeem
or
cup-companion
being
er-rasheeds
favourite
companion
at
the
wine-table
and
his
son
who
enjoyed
the
like
distinction
with
el-ma-moon
received
the
same
appellation
as
well
as
that
of
son
of
the
nedeem
ibrÃheem
was
the
most
famous
musician
of
his
time
at
least
till
his
son
attained
celebrity246

is-áÃá
el-mÃáilee
was
especially
famous
as
a
musician
but
he
was
also
a
good
poet
accomplished
in
general
literature
and
endowed
with
great
wit
he
was
honoured
above
all
other
persons
in
the
pay
of
el-ma-moon
and
enjoyed
a
long
life
but
for
many
years
before
his
death
he
was
blind247

mukhÃriá
appears
to
have
rivalled
his
master
ibrÃheem
the
latter
he
relates
took
him
to
perform
before
er-rasheed
who
used
to
have
a
curtain
suspended
between
him
and
the
musicians
others
he
says
sang
and
he
was
unmoved
but
when
i
sang
he
came
forth
from
behind
the
curtain
and
exclaimed
young
man
hither
and
he
seated
me
upon
the
sereer
a
kind
of
couch
and
gave
me
thirty
thousand
dirhems248
the
following
anecdote
which
i
abridge
a
little
in
translation
shews
his
excellence
in
the
art
which
he
professed
and
the
effect
of
melody
on
an
arabâafter
drinking
with
the
khaleefeh249
a
whole
night
i
asked
his
permission
says
he
to
take
the
air
in
the
ruáÃfeh250
which
he
granted
and
while
i
was
walking
there
i
saw
a
damsel
who
appeared
as
if
the
rising
sun
beamed
from
her
face
she
had
a
basket
and
i
followed
her
she
stopped
at
a
fruiterers
and
bought
some
fruit
and
observing
that
i
was
following
her
she
looked
back
and
abused
me
several
times
but
still
i
followed
her
until
she
arrived
at
a
great
door
after
having
filled
her
basket
with
fruits
and
flowers
and
similar
things
when
she
had
entered
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
i
sat
down
opposite
to
it
deprived
of
my
reason
by
her
beauty
and
knew
that
there
must
be
in
the
house
a
wine-party
the
sun
went
down
upon
me
while
i
sat
there
and
at
length
there
came
two
handsome
young
men
on
asses
and
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
they
were
admitted
i
entered
with
them
the
master
of
the
house
thinking
that
i
was
their
companion
and
they
imagining
that
i
was
one
of
his
friends
a
repast
was
brought
and
we
ate
and
washed
our
hands
and
were
perfumed
the
master
of
the
house
then
said
to
the
two
young
men
have
ye
any
desire
that
i
should
call
such
a
one
mentioning
a
female
name
they
answered
if
thou
wilt
grant
us
the
favour
wellâso
he
called
for
her
and
she
came
and
lo
she
was
the
maiden
whom
i
had
seen
before
and
who
had
abused
me
a
servant-maid
preceded
her
bearing
her
lute
which
she
placed
in
her
lap
wine
was
then
brought
and
she
sang
while
we
drank
and
shook
with
delight
whose
air
is
that
they
asked
she
answered
seedee251
mukhÃriás
she
then
sang
another
air
which
also
203she
said
was
mine
while
they
drank
by
pints
she
looking
aside
and
doubtfully
at
me
until
i
lost
my
patience
and
called
out
to
her
to
do
her
best
but
in
attempting
to
do
so
singing
a
third
air
she
overstrained
her
voice
and
i
said
thou
hast
made
a
mistakeâupon
which
she
threw
the
lute
from
her
lap
in
anger
so
that
she
nearly
broke
it
saying
take
it
thyself
and
let
us
hear
thee
i
answered
well
and
having
taken
it
and
tuned
it
perfectly
sang
the
first
of
the
airs
which
she
had
sung
before
me
whereupon
all
of
them
sprang
upon
their
feet
and
kissed
my
head
i
then
sang
the
second
air
and
the
third
and
their
reason
almost
fled
from
ecstasy
the
master
of
the
house
after
asking
his
guests
and
being
told
by
them
that
they
knew
me
not
came
to
me
and
kissing
my
hand
said
by
allah
my
master
who
art
thou
i
answered
by
allah
i
am
the
singer
mukhÃriáâand
for
what
purpose
said
he
kissing
both
my
hands
camest
thou
hither
i
replied
as
a
spungerâand
related
what
had
happened
with
respect
to
the
maiden
whereupon
he
looked
towards
his
two
companions
and
said
to
them
tell
me
by
allah
do
ye
not
know
that
i
gave
for
that
girl
thirty
thousand
dirhems
and
have
refused
to
sell
her
they
answered
it
is
so
then
said
he
i
take
you
as
witnesses
that
i
have
given
her
to
himâand
we
said
the
two
friends
will
pay
thee
two-thirds
of
her
price
so
he
put
me
in
possession
of
the
girl
and
in
the
evening
when
i
departed
he
presented
me
also
with
rich
dresses
and
other
gifts
with
all
of
which
i
went
away
and
as
i
passed
the
places
where
the
maiden
had
abused
me
i
said
to
her
repeat
thy
words
to
me
but
she
could
not
for
shame
holding
the
girls
hand
i
went
with
her
immediately
to
the
khaleefeh
whom
i
found
in
anger
at
my
long
absence
but
when
i
related
my
story
to
him
he
was
surprised
and
laughed
and
ordered
that
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
two
friends
should
be
brought
before
him
that
he
might
requite
them
to
the
former
he
gave
forty
thousand
dirhems
to
each
of
his
two
friends
thirty
thousand
and
to
me
a
hundred
thousand
and
i
kissed
his
feet
and
departed252

it
is
particularly
necessary
for
the
arab
musician
that
he
have
a
retentive
memory
well
stocked
with
choice
pieces
of
poetry
and
with
facetious
or
pleasant
anecdotes
interspersed
with
songs
and
that
he
have
a
ready
wit
aided
by
dramatic
talent
to
employ
these
materials
with
good
effect
if
to
such
qualifications
he
adds
fair
attainments
in
the
difficult
rules
of
grammar
a
degree
of
eloquence
comic
humour
and
good
temper
and
is
not
surpassed
by
many
in
his
art
he
is
sure
to
be
a
general
favourite
very
few
muslims
of
the
higher
classes
have
condescended
to
study
music
because
they
would
have
been
despised
by
their
inferiors
for
doing
so
or
because
they
themselves
have
despised
or
condemned
the
art
ibrÃheem
the
son
of
the
khaleefeh
el-mahdee
and
competitor
of
el-ma-moon
was
a
remarkable
exception
he
is
said
to
have
been
an
excellent
musician
and
a
good
singer

in
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
the
vocal
and
instrumental
performers
were
usually
as
is
the
case
in
many
houses
in
the
present
age
domestic
female
slaves
well
instructed
in
their
art
by
hired
male
or
female
professors
in
the
work
before
us
these
slaves
are
commonly
described
as
standing
or
sitting
unveiled
in
the
presence
of
male
guests
but
from
several
descriptions
of
musical
entertainments
that
i
have
met
with
in
arabic
works
it
appears
that
according
to
the
more
approved
custom
in
respectable
society
they
were
concealed
on
such
occasions
behind
a
curtain
which
generally
closed
the
front
of
an
elevated
recess
in
all
the
houses
of
wealthy
arabs
that
i
have
entered
one
or
each
of
the
larger
saloons
has
an
elevated
closet
the
front
of
which
is
closed
by
a
screen
of
wooden
lattice-work
to
serve
as
an
orchestra
for
the
domestic
or
hired
female
singers
and
instrumental
performers
of
the
hired
performers
any
further
mention
is
not
here
required
but
of
the
slaves
and
free
ladies
who
supplied
their
place
a
few
words
must
be
added
as
very
necessary
to
illustrate
the
preceding
and
many
other
tales
in
this
work

to
a
person
acquainted
with
modern
arabian
manners
it
must
appear
inconsistent
204with
truth
to
describe
such
females
as
exposing
their
faces
before
strange
men
unless
he
can
discover
in
sober
histories
some
evidence
of
their
having
been
less
strict
in
this
respect
than
the
generality
of
arab
females
at
the
present
period
i
find
however
a
remarkable
proof
that
such
was
the
case
in
the
latter
part
of
the
ninth
century

is
generally
of
a
soft

plaintive
character
and
particularly
that
of
the
most
refined
description
which
is
distinguished
by
a
remarkable
peculiarity

division
of
tones
into
thirds
the
singer

at
distinct
enunciation
of

words
for
this

justly
admired
and
delights
in
a
trilling

airs
of

are
commonly
very
short

even
to

there
is

may
suppose
the
right
reading
to

the
title

of
khaleefeh
as
most
of
our
best
authors
on
oriental
subjects
have
for
some
years

deviated
from
our
old
general
mode
of
writing
this

for
caliph

our
language
and
with
its
orthography
in
arabic
characters
otherwise
than
khaleefeh
or
khaleefah
and
of
these
two
modes
i
adopt
the
one
which
agrees
with
the
manner
in
which
the
title
is
most
generally
pronounced
by
the
arabs
the
meaning
of
this
title
is
successor
or
vicar
and
it
was
originally
given
to
the
universal
sovereigns
of
the
muslim
arabs
as
signifying
successor
of
the
prophet
but
afterwards
in
a
more
exalted
sense
as
vicar
of
god
the
khaleefeh
being
the
head
of
the
religion
as
well
as
the
supreme
political
governor
or
at
least
arrogating
to
himself
the
right
to
possess
such
supremacy
throughout
the
whole
muslim
world

last
of
the
khaleefehs

in

khaleefehs
with
spiritual
but
no
temporal
authority
until
it
ceased
in
the
person
of
el-mutawekkil

delegated
his
office
to

to
the
generality
of
muslims

the
distinguished
individuals
above
mentioned
are
known
by
the
common
appellation
of
welees
or
particular
favourites
of
god
the
more
eminent
among
them
compose
a
mysterious
hierarchical
body
whose
government
respects
the
whole
human
race
infidels
as
well
as
believers
but
whose
power
is
often
exercised
in
such
a
manner
that
the
subjects
influenced
by
it
know
not
from
what
person
or
persons
its
effects
proceed
the
general
governor
or
coryphÃus
of
these
holy
beings
is
commonly
called
the
áuáb
which
literally
signifies
a
pole
or
an
axis
and
is
metaphorically
used
to
signify
a
chief
either
in
a
civil
or
political
or
in
a
spiritual
sense
the
áuáb
of
the
saints
is
distinguished
by
other
appellations
he
is
called
áuáb
el-ghÃs
or
ââ
el-ghÃth
the
áuáb
of
invocation
for
help
c
and
simply
el-ghÃs257
the
orders
under
the
rule
of
this
chief
are
called
omud
or
owtÃd
akhyÃr
abdÃl
nujabÃ

and
nuáabÃ

i
name
them
according
to
their
precedence258
perhaps
to
these
should
be
added
an
inferior
order
called
aá-áÃb
ed-darak
which
is
said
to
mean
watchmen
or
overseers
the
members
are
not
known
as
such
to
their
inferior
unenlightened
fellow-creatures
and
are
often
invisible
to
them
this
is
more
frequently
the
case
with
the
áuáb
who
though
generally
stationed
at
mekkeh
on
the
roof
of
the
kaáºbeh
is
never
visible
there
nor
at
any
of
his
other
favourite
stations
or
places
of
resort
yet
his
voice
is
often
heard
at
these
places
whenever
he
and
the
saints
under
his
authority
mingle
among
ordinary
men
they
are
not
distinguished
by
a
dignified
appearance
but
are
always
humbly
clad
these
and
even
inferior
saints
are
said
to
perform
astonishing
miracles
such
as
flying
in
the
air
passing
unhurt
through
fire
swallowing
fire
glass
c
walking
upon
water
transporting
themselves
in
a
moment
of
time
to
immense
distances
and
supplying
themselves
and
others
with
food
in
desert
places
their
supernatural
power
they
are
supposed
to
obtain
by
a
life
of
the
most
exalted
piety
and
especially
by
constant
self-denial
accompanied
with
the
most
implicit
reliance
upon
god
by
the
services
of
good
genii
and
as
many
believe
by
the
knowledge
and
utterance
of
the
most
great
name
of
god
a
miracle
performed
by
a
saint
is
distinguished
by
the
term
karÃmeh
from
one
performed
by
a
prophet
which
is
called
moáºjizeh

el-khiár
and
ilyÃs
or
elias
of
whom
i
have
before
had
occasion
to
speak
are
both
believed
to
have
been
áuábs
and
the
latter
is
called
in
the
áur-Ãn
an
apostle
but
it
is
disputed
whether
the
former
was
a
prophet
or
merely
a
welee
both
are
said
to
have
drunk
of
the
fountain
of
life
and
to
be
in
consequence
still
living
and
ilyÃs
is
209commonly
believed
to
invest
the
successive
áuábs
the
similarity
of
the
miracles
ascribed
to
the
áuábs
and
those
performed
by
elias
or
elijah
i
have
remarked
in
a
former
work
another
miracle
reminding
us
of
the
mantle
of
elijah
in
the
hands
of
his
successor
may
here
be
mentionedâa
saint
who
was
the
áuáb
of
his
time
dying
at
toonis
or
tunis
left
his
clothes
in
trust
to
his
attendant
moáammad
el-ashwam
a
native
of
the
neighbouring
regency
of
tripoli
now
called
áarÃbulus
who
desired
to
sell
these
relics
but
was
counselled
to
retain
them
and
accordingly
though
high
prices
were
bidden
for
them
made
them
his
own
by
purchase
as
soon
as
they
became
his
property
he
was
affected
we
are
told
with
a
divine
ecstasy
and
endowed
with
miraculous
powers259

innumerable
miracles
are
related
to
have
been
performed
by
muslim
saints
and
large
volumes
are
filled
with
the
histories
of
their
wonderful
lives
the
author
of
the
work
from
which
the
above
story
is
taken
mentions
as
a
fact
to
be
relied
on
in
an
account
of
one
of
his
ancestors
that
his
lamp
happening
to
go
out
one
night
while
he
was
reading
alone
in
the
riwÃá
of
the
jabart
of
which
he
was
the
sheykh
in
the
great
mosque
el-azhar
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
emitted
a
light
which
enabled
him
to
continue
his
reading
until
his
naáeeb
had
trimmed
and
lighted
another
lamp260

from
many
stories
of
a
similar
kind
that
i
have
read
i
select
the
following
as
a
fair
specimen
it
is
related
by
a
very
celebrated
saint
ibrÃheem
el-khowwÃáâi
entered
the
desert
on
pilgrimage
to
mekkeh
from
el-erÃá
and
there
joined
me
a
man
having
a
belt
round
his
waist
and
i
said
who
art
thouâhe
answered
a
christian
and
i
desire
thy
company
we
walked
together
for
seven
days
eating
nothing
after
which
he
said
to
me
o
monk
of
the
muslims
produce
what
thou
hast
in
the
way
of
refreshment
for
we
are
hungry
so
i
said
o
my
god
disgrace
me
not
before
this
infidel
and
lo
a
tray
upon
which
were
bread
and
broiled
meat
and
fresh
dates
and
a
mug
of
water
we
ate
and
continued
our
journey
seven
days
more
and
i
then
said
to
him
o
monk
of
the
christians
produce
what
thou
hast
in
the
way
of
refreshment
for
the
turn
is
come
to
thee
whereupon
he
leaned
upon
his
staff
and
prayed
and
lo
two
trays
containing
double
that
which
was
on
my
tray
i
was
confounded
and
refused
to
eat
he
urged
me
saying
eat
but
i
did
it
not
then
said
he
be
glad
for
i
give
thee
two
pieces
of
good
news
one
of
them
is
that
i
testify
that
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
that
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
the
other
that
i
said
o
god
if
there
be
worth
in
this
servant
supply
me
with
two
traysâso
this
is
through
thy
blessing
we
ate
and
the
man
put
on
the
dress
of
pilgrimage
and
so
entered
mekkeh
where
he
remained
with
me
a
year
as
a
student
after
which
he
died
and
i
buried
him
in
the
cemetery
el-maáºlÃ

and
god
says
the
author
from
whom
i
take
this
story
is
all-knowing
ie
he
alone
knoweth
whether
it
be
strictly
true
but
this
is
often
added
to
the
narration
of
traditions
resting
upon
high
authority261âthe
saint
above
mentioned
was
called
el-khowwÃá
or
the
maker
of
palm-leaf
baskets
c
from
the
following
circumstance
related
by
himselfâi
used
said
he
to
go
out
of
the
town
er-rei
and
sit
by
a
river
on
the
banks
of
which
was
abundance
of
palm-leaves
and
it
occurred
to
my
mind
to
make
every
day
five
baskets
áuffehs
and
to
throw
them
into
the
river
for
my
amusement
as
if
i
were
obliged
to
do
so
my
time
was
so
passed
for
many
days
at
length
one
day
i
thought
i
would
walk
after
the
baskets
and
see
whither
they
had
gone
so
i
proceeded
a
while
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
found
an
old
woman
sitting
sorrowful
on
that
day
i
had
made
nothing
i
said
to
her
wherefore
do
i
see
thee
sorrowful
she
answered
i
am
a
210widow
my
husband
died
leaving
five
daughters
and
nothing
to
maintain
them
and
it
is
my
custom
to
repair
every
day
to
this
river
and
there
come
to
me
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
five
baskets
which
i
sell
and
by
means
of
them
i
procure
food
but
to-day
they
have
not
come
and
i
know
not
what
to
do
upon
hearing
this
i
raised
my
head
towards
heaven
and
said
o
my
god
had
i
known
that
i
had
more
than
five
children
to
maintain
i
had
laboured
more
diligently
he
then
took
the
old
woman
to
his
house
and
gave
her
money
and
flour
and
said
to
her
whenever
thou
wantest
anything
come
hither
and
take
what
may
suffice
you262

an
irresistible
influence
has
often
been
exercised
over
the
minds
of
princes
and
other
great
men
by
reputed
saints
many
a
muslim
monarch
has
thus
been
incited
as
the
kings
of
christendom
were
by
peter
the
hermit
to
undertake
religious
wars
or
urged
to
acts
of
piety
and
charity
or
restrained
from
tyranny
by
threats
of
divine
vengeance
to
be
called
down
upon
his
head
by
the
imprecations
of
a
welee
alee
the
favourite
son
of
the
khaleefeh
el-ma-moon
was
induced
for
the
sake
of
religion
to
flee
from
the
splendour
and
luxuries
of
his
fathers
court
and
after
the
example
of
a
self-denying
devotee
to
follow
the
occupation
of
a
porter
in
a
state
of
the
most
abject
poverty
at
el-baárah
fasting
all
the
day
remaining
without
sleep
at
night
in
a
mosque
and
walking
barefooted
until
under
an
accumulation
of
severe
sufferings
he
prematurely
ended
his
days
dying
on
a
mat
the
honours
which
he
refused
to
receive
in
life
were
paid
to
him
after
his
death
his
rank
being
discovered
by
a
ring
and
paper
which
he
left
his
corpse
was
anointed
with
camphor
and
musk
and
aloes
wrapped
in
fine
linen
of
egypt
and
so
conveyed
to
his
distressed
father
at
baghdÃd263

self-denial
i
have
before
mentioned
as
one
of
the
most
important
means
by
which
to
attain
the
dignity
of
a
welee
a
very
famous
saint
esh-shiblee
is
said
to
have
received
from
his
father
an
inheritance
of
sixty
millions
of
deenÃrs
a
sum
incredible
and
probably
a
mistake
for
sixty
thousand
or
for
sixty
million
dirhems
besides
landed
property
and
to
have
expended
it
all
in
charity
also
to
have
thrown
into
the
tigris
seventy
hundred-weight
of
books
written
by
his
own
hand
during
a
period
of
twenty
years264

shÃh
el-karmÃnee
another
celebrated
saint
had
a
beautiful
daughter
whom
the
suláÃn
of
his
country
sought
in
marriage
the
holy
man
required
three
days
to
consider
his
sovereigns
proposal
and
in
the
mean
time
visited
several
mosques
in
one
of
which
he
saw
a
young
man
humbly
occupied
in
prayer
having
waited
till
he
had
finished
he
accosted
him
saying
my
son
hast
thou
a
wife
being
answered
no
he
said
i
have
a
maiden
a
virtuous
devotee
who
hath
learned
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
is
amply
endowed
with
beauty
dost
thou
desire
herâwho
said
the
young
man
will
marry
me
to
such
a
one
as
thou
hast
described
when
i
possess
no
more
than
three
dirhemsâi
will
marry
thee
to
her
answered
the
saint
she
is
my
daughter
and
i
am
shÃh
the
son
of
shujÃáº
el-karmÃnee
give
me
the
dirhems
that
thou
hast
that
i
may
buy
a
dirhems
worth
of
bread
and
a
dirhems
worth
of
something
savoury
and
a
dirhems
worth
of
perfume
the
marriage-contract
was
performed
but
when
the
bride
came
to
the
young
man
she
saw
a
stale
cake
of
bread
placed
upon
the
top
of
his
mug
upon
which
she
put
on
her
izÃr
and
went
out
her
husband
said
now
i
perceive
that
the
daughter
of
shÃh
el-karmÃnee
is
displeased
with
my
poverty
she
answered
i
did
not
withdraw
from
fear
of
poverty
but
on
account
of
the
weakness
of
thy
faith
seeing
how
thou
layest
by
a
cake
of
bread
for
the
morrow265

one
of
my
friends
in
cairo
abu-l-áÃsim
of
geelÃn
mentioned
in
a
former
note
entertained
me
with
a
long
relation
of
the
mortifications
and
other
means
which
he
employed
to
attain
the
rank
of
a
welee
these
were
chiefly
self-denial
and
a
perfect
reliance
upon
providence
he
left
his
home
in
a
state
of
voluntary
destitution
and
211complete
nudity
to
travel
through
persia
and
the
surrounding
countries
and
yet
more
distant
regions
if
necessary
in
search
of
a
spiritual
guide
for
many
days
he
avoided
the
habitations
of
men
fasting
from
daybreak
till
sunset
and
then
eating
nothing
but
a
little
grass
or
a
few
leaves
or
wild
fruits
till
by
degrees
he
habituated
himself
to
almost
total
abstinence
from
every
kind
of
nourishment
his
feet
at
first
blistered
and
cut
by
sharp
stones
soon
became
callous
and
in
proportion
to
his
reduction
of
food
his
frame
contrary
to
the
common
course
of
nature
became
according
to
his
own
account
more
stout
and
lusty
bronzed
by
the
sun
and
with
his
black
hair
hanging
over
his
shoulders
for
he
had
abjured
the
use
of
the
razor
he
presented
in
his
nudity
a
wild
and
frightful
appearance
and
on
his
first
approaching
a
town
was
surrounded
and
pelted
by
a
crowd
of
boys
he
therefore
retreated
and
after
the
example
of
our
first
parents
made
himself
a
partial
covering
of
leaves
and
this
he
always
after
did
on
similar
occasions
never
remaining
long
enough
in
a
town
for
his
leafy
apron
to
wither
the
abodes
of
mankind
he
always
passed
at
a
distance
excepting
when
several
days
fast
while
traversing
an
arid
desert
compelled
him
to
obtain
a
morsel
of
bread
or
a
cup
of
water
from
the
hand
of
some
charitable
fellow-creature
one
thing
that
he
particularly
dreaded
was
to
receive
relief
from
a
sinful
man
or
from
a
demon
in
the
human
form
in
passing
over
a
parched
and
desolate
tract
where
for
three
days
he
had
found
nothing
to
eat
not
even
a
blade
of
grass
nor
a
spring
from
which
to
refresh
his
tongue
he
became
overpowered
with
thirst
and
prayed
that
god
would
send
him
a
messenger
with
a
pitcher
of
water
but
said
he
let
the
water
be
in
a
green
baghdÃhee
pitcher
that
i
may
know
it
be
from
thee
and
not
from
the
devil
and
when
i
ask
the
bearer
to
give
me
to
drink
let
him
pour
it
over
my
head
that
i
may
not
too
much
gratify
my
carnal
desireâi
looked
behind
me
he
continued
and
saw
a
man
bearing
a
green
baghdÃhee
pitcher
of
water
and
said
to
him
give
me
to
drink
and
he
came
up
to
me
and
poured
the
contents
over
my
head
and
departed
by
allah
it
was
soârejoicing
in
this
miracle
as
a
proof
of
his
having
attained
to
a
degree
of
wilÃyeh
or
saintship
and
refreshed
by
the
water
he
continued
his
way
over
the
desert
more
firm
than
ever
in
his
course
of
self-denial
which
though
imperfectly
followed
had
been
the
means
of
his
being
thus
distinguished
but
the
burning
thirst
returned
shortly
after
and
he
felt
himself
at
the
point
of
sinking
under
it
when
he
beheld
before
him
a
high
hill
with
a
rivulet
running
by
its
base
to
the
summit
of
this
hill
he
determined
to
ascend
by
way
of
mortification
before
he
would
taste
the
water
and
this
point
with
much
difficulty
he
reached
at
the
close
of
the
day
here
standing
he
saw
approaching
below
a
troop
of
horsemen
who
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
when
their
chief
who
was
foremost
called
out
to
him
by
name
o
abu-l-áÃsim
o
geelÃnee
come
down
and
drinkâbut
persuaded
by
this
that
he
was
iblees
with
a
troop
of
his
sons
the
evil
genii
he
withstood
the
temptation
and
remained
stationary
until
the
deceiver
with
his
attendants
had
passed
on
and
were
out
of
sight
the
sun
had
then
set
his
thirst
had
somewhat
abated
and
he
only
drank
a
few
drops
continuing
his
wanderings
in
the
desert
he
found
upon
a
pebbly
plain
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
who
accosted
him
asking
of
what
he
was
in
search
i
am
seeking
he
answered
a
spiritual
guide
and
my
heart
tells
me
that
thou
art
the
guide
i
seek
my
son
said
the
old
man
thou
seest
yonder
a
saints
tomb
it
is
a
place
where
prayer
is
answered
go
thither
enter
it
and
seat
thyself
neither
eat
nor
drink
nor
sleep
but
occupy
thyself
solely
day
and
night
in
repeating
silently
lÃ
ilÃha
illa-llÃh
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
let
not
any
living
creature
see
thy
lips
move
in
doing
so
for
among
the
peculiar
virtues
of
these
words
is
this
that
they
may
be
uttered
without
any
motion
of
the
lips
go
and
peace
be
on
theeâaccordingly
said
my
friend
i
went
thither
it
was
a
small
square
building
crowned
by
a
cupola
and
the
door
was
open
i
entered
and
seated
myself
facing
the
niche
and
the
oblong
monument
over
the
grave
it
was
evening
and
i
commenced
my
silent
professions
of
the
unity
as
directed
by
my
guide
and
at
dusk
i
saw
a
white
figure
seated
beside
me
as
if
assisting
in
my
devotional
task
i
stretched
forth
my
hand
to
touch
it
but212
found
that
it
was
not
a
material
substance
yet
there
it
was
i
saw
it
distinctly
encouraged
by
this
vision
i
continued
my
task
for
three
nights
and
days
without
intermission
neither
eating
not
drinking
yet
increasing
in
strength
both
of
body
and
of
spirit
and
on
the
third
day
i
saw
written
upon
the
whitewashed
walls
of
the
tomb
and
on
the
ground
and
in
the
air
wherever
i
turned
my
eyes
lÃ
ilÃha
illa-llÃh
and
whenever
a
fly
entered
the
tomb
it
formed
these
words
in
its
flight
by
allah
it
was
so
my
object
was
now
fully
attained
i
felt
myself
endowed
with
supernatural
knowledge
thoughts
of
my
friends
and
acquaintances
troubled
me
not
but
i
knew
where
each
of
them
was
in
persia
india
arabia
and
turkey
and
what
each
was
doing
i
experienced
an
indescribable
happiness
this
state
lasted
several
years
but
at
length
i
was
insensibly
enticed
back
to
worldly
objects
i
came
to
this
country
my
fame
as
a
caligraphist
drew
me
into
the
service
of
the
government
and
now
see
what
i
am
decked
with
pelisses
and
shawls
and
with
this
thing
a
diamond
order
on
my
breast
too
old
i
fear
to
undergo
again
the
self-denial
necessary
to
restore
me
to
true
happiness
though
i
have
almost
resolved
to
make
the
attemptâsoon
after
this
conversation
he
was
deprived
of
his
office
and
died
of
the
plague
he
was
well
known
to
have
passed
several
years
as
a
wandering
devotee
and
his
sufferings
combined
with
enthusiasm
perhaps
disordered
his
imagination
and
made
him
believe
that
he
really
saw
the
strange
sights
which
he
described
to
me
for
there
was
an
appearance
of
earnestness
and
sincerity
in
his
manner
such
as
i
thought
could
hardly
be
assumed
by
a
conscious
impostor

insanity
however
if
not
of
a
very
violent
and
dangerous
nature
is
commonly
regarded
by
muslims
as
a
quality
that
entitles
the
subject
of
it
to
be
esteemed
as
a
saint
being
supposed
to
be
the
abstraction
of
the
mind
from
worldly
affairs
and
its
total
devotion
to
god
this
popular
superstition
is
a
fertile
source
of
imposture
for
a
reputation
for
sanctity
being
so
easily
obtained
and
supported
there
are
numbers
of
persons
who
lay
claim
to
it
from
motives
of
indolence
and
licentiousness
eager
to
receive
alms
merely
for
performing
the
tricks
of
madmen
and
greedy
of
indulging
in
pleasures
forbidden
by
the
law
such
indulgences
not
being
considered
in
their
case
as
transgressions
by
the
common
people
but
rather
as
indications
of
holy
frenzy
from
my
own
observation
i
should
say
that
lunatics
or
idiots
or
impostors
constitute
the
majority
of
the
persons
reputed
to
be
saints
among
the
muslims
of
the
present
day
and
most
of
those
who
are
not
more
than
slightly
tinged
with
insanity
are
darweeshes

a
reputed
saint
of
this
description
in
cairo
in
whom
persons
of
some
education
put
great
faith
affected
to
have
a
particular
regard
for
me
he
several
times
accosted
me
in
an
abrupt
manner
acquainted
me
with
the
state
of
my
family
in
england
and
uttered
incoherent
predictions
respecting
me
all
of
which
communications
excepting
one
which
he
qualified
with
an
in
shÃa-llÃh
or
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
i
must
confess
proved
to
be
true
but
i
must
also
state
that
he
was
acquainted
with
two
of
my
friends
who
might
have
materially
assisted
him
to
frame
these
predictions
though
they
protested
to
me
that
they
had
not
done
so
the
following
extract
from
a
journal
which
i
kept
in
cairo
during
my
second
visit
to
egypt
will
convey
some
idea
of
this
person
who
will
serve
as
a
picture
of
many
of
his
fraternityâto-day
nov
6th
1834
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
shop
of
the
bÃshÃ
s
booksellers
a
reputed
saint
whom
i
have
often
seen
here
came
and
seated
himself
by
me
and
began
in
a
series
of
abrupt
sentences
to
relate
to
me
various
matters
respecting
me
past
present
and
to
come
he
is
called
the
sheykh

he
is
a
poor
man
supported
by
alms
tall
and
thin
and
very
dark
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
wears
nothing
at
present
but
a
blue
shirt
and
a
girdle
and
a
padded
red
cap
o
efendee
he
said
thou
hast
been
very
anxious
for
some
days
there
is
a
grain
of
anxiety
remaining
in
thee
yet
do
not
fear
there
is
a
letter
coming
to
thee
by
sea
that
will
bring
thee
good
news
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
of
the
state
of
my
family
and
that
all
were
well
excepting
one
whom
he
particularized
by
description
and
who
he
stated
to
be
then
suffering
from
an
intermittent
fever
this
proved
to
be
exactly
true
this
affliction
he
continued

then
took
my

in
the
manner

in

ceremony

repeated
the

conduct

esteemed

these
lines
are
quoted
by
el-jabartee
in
his
account
of
a
very
celebrated
modern
saint
the
seyyid
alee
el-bekree
events
of
rabeeáº
eth-thÃnee
1214
a
brief
history
of
this
person
will
not
be
here
misplaced
as
it
will
present
a
good
illustration
of
the
general
character
and
actions
of
those
insane
individuals
who
are
commonly
regarded
as
saints

the
seyyid
alee
el-bekree
was
a
mejzoob
or
insane
person
who
was
considered
an
eminent
welee
and
much
trusted
in
for
several
years
he
used
to
walk
naked
about
the
streets
of
cairo
with
a
shaven
face
bearing
a
long
nebboot
or
staff
and
uttering
confused
language
which
the
people
attentively
listened
to
and
interpreted
according
to
their
desires
and
the
exigencies
of
their
states
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
and
sometimes
wore
a
shirt
and
a
cotton
skull-cap
but
he
was
generally
barefooted
and
naked
the
respect
with
which
he
was
treated
induced
a
woman
who
was
called
the
sheykhah
ammooneh
to
imitate
his
example
further
than
decency
allowed
she
followed
him
whithersoever
he
went
covered
at
first
with
her
izÃr
or
large
cotton
veil
thrown
over
the
head
and
body
and
muttering
like
him
confused
language
entering
private
houses
with
him
she
used
to
ascend
to
the
áareems
and
gained
the
faith
of
the
women
who
presented
her
with
money
and
clothes
and
spread
abroad
that
the
sheykh
alee
had
looked
upon
her
and
affected
her
with
religious
frenzy
so
that
she
had
become
a
weleeyeh
or
female
saint
afterwards
becoming
more
insane
and
intoxicated
she
uncovered
her
face
and
put
on
the
clothing
of
a
man
and
thus
attired
she
still
accompanied
the
sheykh
and
the
two
wandered
about
followed
by
numbers
of
children
and
common
vagabonds
some
of
whom
also
stripped
off
their
clothes
in
imitation
of
the
sheykh
and
followed
dancing
their
mad
actions
being
attributed
like
those
of
the
woman
to
religious
frenzy
induced
by
his
look
or
touch
which
converted
them
into
saints
the
vulgar
and
young
who
daily
followed
them
consequently
increased
in
numbers
and
some
of
them
in
passing
through
the
market-streets
snatched
away
goods
from
the
shops
thus
exciting
great
commotion
wherever
they
went
when
the
sheykh
sat
down
in
any
place
the
crowd
stopped
and
the
people
pressed
to
see
him
and
his
mad
companions
on
these
occasions
the
woman
used
to
mount
upon
the
maááabah
of
a
shop
or
ascend
a
hillock
and
utter
disgusting
language
sometimes
in
arabic
and
sometimes
in
turkish
while
many
persons
among
her
audience
would
kiss
her
hands
to
derive
a
blessing
after
having
persevered
for
some
time
in
this
course
none
preventing
them
the
party
entered
one
day
the
lane
leading
from
the
principal
street
of
the
city
to
the
house
of
the
áÃáee
and
were
seized
by
a
turkish
officer
there
residing
named
jaáºfar
kÃshif
who
having
brought
them
into
his
house
gave
the
sheykh
some
food
and
drove
out
the
spectators
retaining
the
woman
and
the
mejzoobs
whom
he
placed
in
confinement
he
then
liberated
the
sheykh
alee
brought
out
the
woman
and
the
mejzoobs
and
beat
them
sent
the
woman
to
the
mÃristÃn
and
there
confined
her
and
set
at
large
the
rest
after
they
had
prayed
for
mercy
and
clothed
themselves
and
recovered
from
their
intoxication
the
woman
remained
a
while
confined
in
the
mÃristÃn
and
when
liberated
lived
alone
as
a
sheykhah
believed
in
by
men
and
women
and
honoured
as
a
saint
with
visits
and
festivals

the
seyyid
alee
after
he
had
thus
been
deprived
of
his
companions
and
imitators
was
constrained
to
lead
a
different
kind
of
life
he
had
a
cunning
brother
who
to
turn
the
folly
of
this
saint
to
a
good
account
and
fill
his
own
purse
seeing
how
great
faith
the
people
placed
in
him
as
the
egyptians
are
prone
to
do
in
such
a
case
confined
him
in
his
house
and
clothed
him
asserting
that
he
had
his
permission
to
do
so
and
that
he
had
been
invested
with
the
dignity
of
áuáb
thus
he
contrived
to
attract
crowds
of
persons
men
and
women
to
visit
him
he
forbade
him
to
shave
his
beard
which
consequently
grew
to
its
full
size
and
his
body
became
fat
and
stout
from
abundance
of
food
and
rest
for
while
he
went
about
naked
he
was
as
before
mentioned
of
a
lean
figure
during
that
period
he
used
generally
to
pass
the
night
wandering
without
food
through
the
streets
in
winter
and
summer
having
now
servants
to
wait
upon
him
whether
sleeping
or
waking
he
passed
his
time
in
idleness215
uttering
confused
and
incoherent
words
and
sometimes
laughing
and
sometimes
scolding
and
in
the
course
of
his
idle
loquacity
he
could
not
but
let
fall
some
words
applicable
to
the
affairs
of
some
of
his
listening
visiters
who
attributed
such
expressions
to
his
supernatural
knowledge
of
the
thoughts
of
their
hearts
and
interpreted
them
as
warnings
or
prophecies
men
and
women
and
particularly
the
wives
of
the
grandees
flocked
to
him
with
presents
and
votive
offerings
which
enriched
the
coffers
of
his
brother
and
the
honours
which
he
received
ceased
not
with
his
death
his
funeral
was
attended
by
multitudes
from
every
quarter
his
brother
buried
him
in
the
mosque
of
esh-sharÃÃbee
in
the
quarter
of
the
ezbekeeyeh
made
for
him
a
maááoorah
or
railed
enclosure
and
an
oblong
monument
over
the
grave
and
frequently
repaired
thither
with
readers
of
the
áur-Ãn
munshids269
to
sing
odes
in
his
honour
flag-bearers
and
other
persons
who
wailed
and

walks
round

from

with
his

side
towards
it
as
the
pilgrims
do
round
the
kaáºbeh

pausing
to
touch
its

angles

corners
with

he
then

recites
the
opening
chapter
of

some
visiters
repeat

annual
festivals

observed
with
additional
ceremonies
and
by
crowds
of
visiters
these
are
called
moolids
more
properly
mÃlids
and
are
held
on
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
the

or
in
commemoration
of
that
event
persons
are
then
hired
to
recite
the
áur-Ãn
in
and
near
the
tomb
during
the
day
and
others
chiefly
darweeshes
employ
themselves
during
the
night
in
performing
zikrs
which
consist
in
repeating
the
name
of
god
or
the
profession
of
his
unity
c
in
chorus
accompanying
the
words
by
certain
motions
of
the

at
intervals
singing
religious
odes
or
love
songs
during
these
performances
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
nÃy
which
is
a
kind
of
flute
or
the
arghool
which
is
a
double
reed-pipe
these
moolids
are
scenes
of
rejoicing
and
of
traffic

men
and
boys
and
girls
attend
to
eat
sweatmeats
and
drink
coffee
and
sherbets

to
amuse
themselves
with
swinging
or
turning
on
a
whirligig
or
witnessing

feats
of

performances
of

great
moolids

in
the
delta
of
egypt
which
are
great
fairs
as
well
as
religious
festivals
are
almost
as
numerous
as
the
pilgrims
at
mekkeh
during
a
moolid
the
inhabitants
of
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
tomb
hang
lamps
before
their
houses
and
spend
a
great
part
of
the
night
listening
to
the
story-tellers
at
the
coffee-shops
or
attending
the
zikrs

these
latter
performances
though
so
common
among
the
arabs
are
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
mohammadan
religion
and
especially
with
respect
to
music
which
was
not
employed
in
religious
ceremonies
until
after
the
second
century
of
the
flight
the
imÃm
aboo-bekr

being
asked
whether
it
were
lawful
or
not
to
be
present
with
people
who
assembled
in
a
certain
place
and
read
a
portion
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
after
a
munshid
had
recited
some
poetry
would
dance
and
become
excited
and
play
upon
tambourines
and
pipesâanswered
that
such
practices
were
vain
ignorant
and
erroneous
not
ordained
by
the
áur-Ãn
or
the
traditions
of
the
prophet
but
invented
by
those
israelites
who
worshipped
the
golden
calf
that
the
prophet
and
his
companions
used
to
sit
so
quietly
that
a
bird
might
alight
upon
the
head
of
any
one
of
them
and
not
be
disturbed
that
it
was
incumbent
on
the
sultÃn
and
his
vicegerents
to
prevent
such
persons
from
entering
the
mosques
and
other
places
for
these
purposes
and
that
no
one
who
believed
in
god
and
the
last
day
should
be
present
with
them
or
assist
them
in
their
vain
performances
such
he
asserted
was
the
opinion
of
the
imÃms
of
the
muslims271
some
eminent
doctors
however
have
contended
for
the
lawfulness
of
these
practices272

of
the
various
orders
of
darweeshes
to
which
so
many
of
the
reputed
saints
belong
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
say
more
than
that
they
differ
chiefly
in
unimportant
regulations
and
rites
such
as
particular
forms
of
prayer
and
modes
of
zikr
that
some
distinguish
themselves
by
peculiar
dresses
and
that
a
few
pursue
a
wandering
life
and
subsist
on
alms

dreams
that
dreams
are
regarded
by
the
muslims
as
being
often
true
warnings
or
indications
of
future
events
i
have
mentioned
in
a
former
note
this
belief
sanctioned
by
the
prophet
will
be
well
illustrated
by
the
following
anecdote
which
was
related
to
me
in
cairo
shortly
after
the
terrible
plague
of
the
year
1835
by
the
sheykh
moáammad
eá-áanáÃwee
who
had
taken
the
trouble
of
investigating
the
fact
and
had
ascertained
its
truth

a
tradesman
living
in
the
quarter
of
el-áanafee
in
cairo
dreamt
during
the
plague
above
mentioned
that
eleven
persons
were
carried
out
from
his
house
to
be
buried
victims
of
this
disease
he
awoke
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
distress
and
alarm
reflecting
that
eleven
was
the
total
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
his
house
including
himself
and
that
it
would
be
vain
in
him
to
attempt
by
adding
one
or
more
members
to
his
household
to
elude
the
decree
of
god
and
give
himself
a
chance
of
escape
so
calling
together
his
neighbours
he
informed
them
of
his
dream
and
was
counselled
to
submit
with
resignation
to
a
fate
so
plainly
foreshewn
and
to
be
thankful
to
god
for
the
timely
notice
with
which
he
had
been
mercifully
favoured
on
the
following
day
one
of
his
children
died
a
day
or
two
after
a
wife
and
the
pestilence
continued
its
ravages
among
his
family
until
he
remained
in
his
house
alone
it
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
entertain
the
slightest
doubt
of
the
entire
accomplishment
of
the
warning
immediately
therefore
after
the
last
death
that
had
taken
place
among
his
household
he
repaired
to
a
friend
at
a
neighbouring
shop
and
calling
to
him
several
other
persons
from
the
adjoining
and
opposite
shops
he
reminded
them
of
his
dream
acquainted
them
with
its
almost
complete
fulfilment
and
expressed
his
conviction
that
he
the
eleventh
should
very
soon
die
perhaps
said
he
i
shall
die
this
next
218night
i
beg
of
you
therefore
for
the
sake
of
god
to
come
to
my
house
early
to-morrow
morning
and
the
next
morning
and
the
next
if
necessary
and
to
see
if
i
be
dead
and
when
dead
that
i
be
properly
buried
for
i
have
no
one
with
me
to
wash
and
shroud
me
fail
not
to
do
me
this
service
which
will
procure
you
a
recompense
in
heaven
i
have
bought
my
grave-linen
you
will
find
it
in
a
corner
of
the
room
in
which
i
sleep
if
you
find
the
door
of
the
house
latched
and
i
do
not
answer
to
your
knocking
break
it
open

soon
after
sunset
he
laid
himself
in
his
lonely
bed
though
without
any
expectation
of
closing
his
eyes
in
sleep
for
his
mind
was
absorbed
in
reflections
upon
the
awful
entry
into
another
world
and
a
review
of
his
past
life
as
the
shades
of
night
gathered
around
him
he
could
almost
fancy
that
he
beheld
in
one
faint
object
or
another
in
his
gloomy
chamber
the
dreadful
person
of
the
angel
of
death
and
at
length
he
actually
perceived
a
figure
gliding
in
at
the
door
and
approaching
his
bed
starting
up
in
horror
he
exclaimed
who
art
thouâand
a
stern
and
solemn
voice
answered
be
silent
i
am
azraeel
the
angel
of
deathâalas
cried
the
terrified
man
i
testify
that
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
i
testify
that
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
to
god
we
belong
and
to
him
we
must
returnâhe
then
covered
himself
over
with
his
quilt
as
if
for
protection
and
lay
with
throbbing
heart
expecting
every
moment
to
have
his
soul
torn
from
him
by
the
inexorable
messenger
but
moments
passed
away
and
minutes
and
hours
yet
without
his
experiencing
any
hope
of
escape
for
he
imagined
that
the
angel
was
waiting
for
him
to
resign
himself
or
had
left
him
for
a
while
and
was
occupied
in
receiving
first
the
souls
of
the
many
hundred
human
beings
who
had
attained
their
predestined
term
in
that
same
night
and
in
the
same
city
and
the
souls
of
the
thousands
who
were
doomed
to
employ
him
elsewhere
daybreak
arrived
before
his
sufferings
terminated
and
his
neighbours
coming
according
to
their
promise
entered
his
chamber
and
found
him
still
in
bed
but
observing
that
he
was
covered
up
and
motionless
as
a
corpse
they
doubted
whether
he
were
still
alive
and
called
to
him
he
answered
with
a
faint
voice
i
am
not
yet
dead
but
the
angel
of
death
came
to
me
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
i
expect
every
moment
his
return
to
take
my
soul
therefore
trouble
me
not
but
see
me
washed
and
buriedâbut
why
said
his
friends
was
the
street-door
left
unlatchedâi
latched
it
he
answered
but
the
angel
of
death
may
have
opened
itâand
who
they
asked
is
the
man
in
the
courtâhe
answered
i
know
of
no
man
in
the
court
perhaps
the
angel
who
is
waiting
for
my
soul
has
made
himself
visible
to
you
and
been
mistaken
in
the
twilight
for
a
manâhe
is
a
thief
they
said
who
has
gathered
together
everything
in
the
house
that
he
could
carry
away
and
has
been
struck
by
the
plague
while
doing
so
and
now
lies
dead
in
the
court
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
grasping
in
his
hand
a
silver
candlestickâthe
master
of
the
house
after
hearing
this
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
throwing
off
his
quilt
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
all
creatures
that
is
the
eleventh
and
i
am
safe
no
doubt
it
was
that
rascal
who
came
to
me
and
said
that
he
was
the
angel
of
death

be

two
ambassadors
from
the
greek
emperor
constantine
ix
porphyrogenitus
arrived
in
baghdÃd
on
a
mission
to
the
khaleefeh
el-muátedir
bringing
an
abundance
of
costly
presents
and
the
scenes
which
they
witnessed
are
thus
described
apparently
however
not
without
some
exaggeration
they
were
first
received
by
the
wezeer
who
at
the
audience
which
he
granted
to
them
in
his
garden-palace
displayed
on
this
occasion
a
degree
of
magnificence
that
had
never
before
been
manifested
by
any
of
his
rank
pages
memlooks
and
soldiers
crowded
the
avenues
and
courts
of
his
mansion
the
apartments
of
which
were
hung
with
tapestry
of
the
value
of
thirty
thousand
deenÃrs
and
the
wezeer
himself
was
surrounded
by
generals
and
other
officers
on
his
right
and
left
and
behind
his
seat
when
the
two
ambassadors
approached
him
dazzled
by
the
splendour
that
surrounded
them
to
beg
for
an
interview
with
the
khaleefeh
el-muátedir
having
appointed
a
day
on
which
he
would
receive
them
ordered
that
the
courts
and
passages
and
avenues
of
his
palace
should
be
filled
with
armed
men
and
that
all
the
apartments
should
be
furnished
with
the
utmost
magnificence
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
armed
soldiers
were
arranged
in
ranks
in
the
approach
to
the
palace
next
to
these
were
the
pages
of

closets

chief
eunuchs
clad
in

and
with
belts
set
with
jewels
in
number
seven
thousand

thousand
white
and
three
thousand

there
were
also
seven
hundred
chamberlains
and
beautifully
ornamented
boats
of
various
kinds
were
seen
floating
upon
the
tigris
hard
by
the
two
ambassadors
passed
first
by
the
palace
of
the
chief
chamberlain
and
astonished
at
the
splendid
ornaments
and
pages
and
arms
which
they
there
beheld
imagined
that
this
was
the
palace
of
the
khaleefeh
but
what
they
had
seen
here
was
eclipsed
by
what
they
beheld
in
the
latter
where
they
were
amazed
by
the
sight
of
thirty-eight
thousand
pieces
of
tapestry
of
gold-embroidered
silk
brocade
and
twenty-two
thousand
magnificent
carpets
here
also
were
two
menageries
of
beasts
by
nature
wild
but
tamed
by
art
and
eating
from
the
hands
of
men
among
them
were
a
hundred
lions
each
lion
with
its
keeper
they
then
entered
the
palace

the
tree
enclosing
a
pond
from
which
rose

had
eighteen
branches
with
leaves
of

being
artificial
and
with
birds
of
gold
and
silver

gilt
and
silvered
of
every
variety
of
kind
and
size
perched
upon
its
branches
so
constructed
that
each
of
them
sang
thence
they
passed
into
the
garden
in
which
were
furniture
and
utensils
not
to
be
enumerated
in
the
passages
leading
to
it
were
suspended
ten
thousand
gilt
coats
of
mail
being
at
length
conducted
before
el-muátedir
they
found
him
seated
on
a
couch
of
ebony
inlaid
with
gold
and
silver
to
the
right
of
which
were
hung
nine
necklaces
of
jewels
and

paused
at
the
distance
of
about
a
hundred
cubits
from
the
khaleefeh

the
interpreter
having
left
the
presence
they
were
conducted
through
the
palace

were
shewn
splendidly-caparisoned
elephants
a
giraffe
lynxes
and
other
beasts

clad
with
robes
of
honour
and
to

was
brought
fifty
thousand
dirhems
together
with

it
is
added
that
the

approached
the
palace
through
a
street
called
the
street
of
the
menÃrehs
in
which
were
a
thousand
menÃrehs

it
was
at
the
hour

and
as
they
passed
the
muÃddins
from
all
these
menÃrehs
chanted
the
call
to
prayer
at
the

time
so
that
the
earth
almost
quaked
at
the
sound
and
the
ambassadors
were
struck
with

baffled

the

was
white

he
was
so
covered
with
jewels
of
an
extraordinary
size
and
their
splendour
from

said

we
will
go
down
to-night
into
the
city
and
inquire
respecting
the
affairs
of
those
who
are
at
present
in
authority
and
him
against
whom
any
one
shall
complain
we
will

jaáºfar
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
when
the
khaleefeh
had
gone
forth
with
him
and
mesroor
and
they
had
passed
through
several
of
the
market-streets
they
proceeded
along
a
lane
and
saw
there
an
old
man
with
a
net
and
basket
upon
his
head
and
a
staff
in
his
hand
walking
at
his
leisure
and
reciting
these
verses223â

they
say
to
me
thou
shinest
among
mankind
by
thy
knowledge
like
the
moonlight
night
but
i
answer
abstain
from
thus
addressing
me
since
there
is
no
knowledge
without
power
for
if
they
would
pawn
me
and
my
knowledge
with
me
and
all
my
papers
and
inkhorn
too
for
one
days
food
they
would
never
find
the
pledge
accepted
to
the
day
of
judgment
as
for
the
poor
and
his
condition
and
his
whole
life
how
full
of
trouble
in
the
summer
he
fails
to
earn
his
food
and
in
winter
he
warms
himself
over
the
fire-pot2
the
dogs
follow
him
wherever
he
goes
and
any
reviler
and
he
cannot
repel
him
if
he
states
his
case
and
proves
himself
wronged
the
judge
will
not
admit
his
plea
such
then
being
the
poor
mans
life
his
fittest
place
is
in
the
burial-ground3
the
khaleefeh
when
he
heard
his
recitation
said
to
jaáºfar
observe
this
poor
man
and
consider
these
verses
for
they
indicate
his
necessity
then
approaching
the
man
he
said
to
him
o
sheykh
what
is
thine
occupationâo
my
master
answered
the
old
man
i
am
a
fisherman
and
have
a
family
to
maintain
and
i
went
forth
from
my
house
at
noon
and
have
remained
until
now
but
god
hath
allotted
me
nothing
wherewith
to
obtain
food
for
my
household
therefore
i
have
hated
myself
and
wished
for
deathâwilt
thou
said
the
khaleefeh
return
with
us
to
the
river
and
station
thyself
on
the
bank
of
the
tigris
and
cast
thy
net
for
my
luck
if
thou
wilt
do
so
i
will
purchase
of
thee
whatever
cometh
up
for
a
hundred
pieces
of
goldâthe
fisherman
rejoiced
when
he
heard
these
words
and
said
on
my
head
be
your
commands
i
will
return
with
youâso
he
went
again
to
the
river
and
cast
his
net
and
having
waited
till
it
sank
drew
the
cords
and
dragged
back
the
net
and
there
came
up
in
it
a
chest
locked
and
heavy
when
the
khaleefeh
saw
it
he
felt
its
weight
and
found
it
to
be
heavy
and
he
gave
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
to
the
fisherman
who
went
away
while
mesroor
assisted
by
jaáºfar
took
up
the
chest
and
conveyed
it
in
company
with
the
khaleefeh
to
the
palace
where
they
lighted
the
candles
and
placed
the
chest
before
the
khaleefeh
jaáºfar
and
mesroor
then
broke
it
open
and
they
found
in
it
a
basket
of
palm-leaves
sewed
up
with
red
worsted
and
they
cut
the
threads
and
saw
within
it
a
piece
of
carpet
and
lifting
up
this
they
found
beneath
it
an
izÃr4
and
when
they
had
taken
up
the
izÃr
they
discovered
under
it
a
damsel
like
molten
silver
killed
and
cut
in
pieces

when
the
khaleefeh
beheld
this
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
looking
towards
jaáºfar
he
exclaimed
o
dog
of
wezeers
shall
people
be
murdered
in
my
time
and
be
thrown
into
the
river
and
become224
burdens
upon
my
responsibility
by
allah
i
must
retaliate
for
this
damsel
upon
him
who
killed
her
and
put
him
to
deathâthen
said
he
to
jaáºfar
by
the
truth
of
my
descent
from
the
khaleefehs
of
the
sons
of
el-abbÃs
if
thou
do
not
bring
to
me
him
who
killed
this
woman
that
i
may
avenge
her
upon
him
i
will
crucify
thee
at
the
gate
of
my
palace
together
with
forty
of
thy
kinsmen5
and
the
khaleefeh
was
enragedâgrant
me
said
jaáºfar
a
delay
of
three
daysâi
grant
thee
the
delay
replied
the
khaleefeh
jaáºfar
then
went
forth
from
his
presence
and
took
his
route
through
the
city
sorrowful
and
saying
within
himself
how
shall
i
discover
him
who
killed
this
damsel
that
i
may
take
him
before
the
khaleefeh
and
if
i
take
to
him
any
other
person
he
will
become
a
weight
upon
my
conscience
i
know
not
what
to
doâfor
three
days
he
remained
in
his
house
and
on
the
fourth
day
the
khaleefeh
sent
to
summon
him
and
when
he
had
presented
himself
before
him
said
to
him
where
is
the
murderer
of
the
damselâo
prince
of
the
faithful
answered
jaáºfar
am
i
acquainted
with
things
hidden
from
the
senses
that
i
should
know
who
is
her
murderer
the
khaleefeh
incensed
at
this
answer
gave
orders
to
crucify
him
at
the
gate
of
his
palace
and
commanded
a
crier
to
proclaim
through
the
streets
of
baghdÃd
whosoever
desireth
to
amuse
himself
by
seeing
the
crucifixion
of
jaáºfar
el-barmekee
the
wezeer
of
the
khaleefeh
and
the
crucifixion
of
his
kinsmen
at
the
gate
of
the
khaleefehs
palace
let
him
come
forth
and
amuse
himselfâso
the
people
came
forth
from
every
quarter
to
see
the
crucifixion
of
jaáºfar
and
his
kinsmen
and
they
knew
not
the
cause
of
this
the
khaleefeh
then
gave
orders
to
set
up
the
crosses
and
they
did
so
and
placed
the
wezeer
and
his
kinsmen
beneath
to
crucify
them
and
were
awaiting
the
khaleefehs
permission
while
the
people
wept
for
jaáºfar
and
his
relatives

but
while
they
were
thus
waiting
a
handsome
and
neatly-dressed
young
man
came
forward
quickly
through
the
crowd
and
approaching
the
wezeer
said
to
him
safety
to
thee
from
this
predicament
o
chief
of
emeers
and
refuge
of
the
poor
it
was
i
who
killed
the
woman
whom
ye
found
in
the
chest
kill
me
therefore
for
her
and
retaliate
her
death
upon
meâwhen
jaáºfar
heard
these
words
he
rejoiced
for
his
own
deliverance
and
grieved
for
the
young
man
but
while
he
was
speaking
to
him
lo
an
old
sheykh
pressed
hastily
through
the
crowd
to
him
and
the
young
man
and
having
saluted
them
said
o
wezeer
believe
not
the
words
of
this
young
man
for
no
one
killed
the
damsel
but
myself
therefore
retaliate
her
death
upon225
me
the
young
man
however
said
o
wezeer
this
is
an
old
man
imbecile
through
age
he
knoweth
not
what
he
saith
it
was
i
who
killed
her
avenge
her
therefore
upon
meâo
my
son
said
the
sheykh
thou
art
young
and
wilt
find
pleasure
in
the
world
and
i
am
old
and
satiated
with
the
world
i
will
be
a
ransom
for
thee
and
for
the
wezeer
and
his
kinsmen
and
no
one
killed
the
damsel
but
myself
by
allah
therefore
hasten
to
retaliate
upon
me

on
witnessing
this
scene
the
wezeer
was
astonished
and
he
took
the
young
man
and
the
sheykh
to
the
khaleefeh
and
said
o
prince
of
the
faithful
the
murderer
of
the
damsel
hath
comeâwhere
is
he
said
the
khaleefeh
this
young
man
answered
jaáºfar
saith
i
am
the
murdererâand
this
sheykh
accuseth
him
of
falsehood
and
saith
nay
but
i
am
the
murdererâthe
khaleefeh
looking
towards
the
sheykh
and
the
young
man
said
which
of
you
killed
this
damsel
the
young
man
answered
no
one
killed
her
but
myselfâand
the
sheykh
said
also
no
one
killed
her
but
myself
the
khaleefeh
therefore
said
to
jaáºfar
take
them
both
and
crucify
themâif
the
murderer
be
one
replied
jaáºfar
to
kill
the
other
would
be
unjust
the
young
man
then
said
by
him
who
raised
the
heavens
and
spread
out
the
earth
it
was
i
who
killed
the
damselâand
he
gave
an
account
of
the
manner
of
his
killing
her
and
described
what
the
khaleefeh
had
found
the
khaleefeh
therefore
was
convinced
that
the
young
man
was
he
who
had
killed
the
damsel
and
he
was
astonished
and
said
what
was
the
cause
of
thy
killing
this
damsel
unjustly
and
of
thy
confessing
the
murder
without
being
beaten6
and
thy
saying
retaliate
her
death
upon
me
the
young
man
answered
as
followsâ

the
young
man
presenting
the
apples
to
his
wife
know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
this
damsel
was
my
wife
and
the
daughter
of
my
uncle
this
sheykh
was
her
father
and
is
my
uncle
i
married
her
when
she
was
a
virgin
and
god
blessed
me
with
three
male
children
by
her
and
she
loved
me
and
served
me
and
i
saw
in
her
no
evil
at
the
commencement
of
this
month
she
was
attacked
by
a
severe
illness
and
i
brought
to
her
the
physicians
who
attended
her
until
her
health
returned
to
her
and
i
desired
them
to
send
her
to
the
bath
but
she
said
to
me
i
want
something
before
i
enter
the
bath
for
i
have
a
longing
for
itâwhat
is
it
said
i
she
answered
i
have
a
longing
for
an
apple
to
smell
it
and
take
a
bite
from
it
so
i
went
out
immediately
into
the
city
and
searched
for
the
apple
and
would
have
bought
it
had
its
price
been
a
piece
of
gold
but
i
could
not
find
one
i
passed
the
next
night
full
of226
thought
and
when
the
morning
came
i
quitted
my
house
again
and
went
about
to
all
the
gardens
one
after
another
yet
i
found
none
in
them
there
met
me
however
an
old
gardener
of
whom
i
inquired
for
the
apple
and
he
said
to
me
o
my
son
this
is
a
rare
thing
and
not
to
be
found
here
nor
anywhere
except
in
the
garden
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
at
el-baárah
and
preserved
there
for
the
khaleefeh
i
returned
therefore
to
my
wife
and
my
love
for
her
so
constrained
me
that
i
prepared
myself
and
journeyed
fifteen
days
by
night
and
day
in
going
and
returning
and
brought
her
three
apples
which
i
purchased
of
the
gardener
at
el-baárah
for
three
pieces
of
gold
and
going
in
i
handed
them
to
her
but
she
was
not
pleased
by
them227
and
left
them
by
her
side
she
was
then
suffering
from
a
violent
fever
and
she
continued
ill
during
a
period
of
ten
days

after
this
she
recovered
her
health
and
i
went
out
and
repaired
to
my
shop
and
sat
there
to
sell
and
buy7
and
while
i
was
thus
occupied
at
mid-day
there
passed
by
me
a
black
slave
having
in
his
hand
an
apple
with
which
he
was
playing
so
i
said
to
him
whence
didst
thou
get
this
apple
for
i
would
procure
one
like
itâupon
which
he
laughed
and
answered
i
got
it
from
my
sweetheart
i
had
been
absent
and
came
and
found
her
ill
and
she
had
three
apples
and
she
said
to
me
my
unsuspecting
husband
journeyed
to
el-baárah
for
them
and
bought
them
for
three
pieces
of
goldâand
i
took
this
apple
from
herâwhen
i
heard
the
words
of
the
slave
o
prince
of
the
faithful
the
world
became
black
before
my
face
and
i
shut
up
my
shop
and
returned
to
my
house
deprived
of
my
reason
by
excessive
rage
i
found
not
the
third
apple
and
said
to
her
where
is
the
apple
she
answered
i
know
not
whither
it
is
gone
i
was
convinced
thus
that
the
slave
had
spoken
the
truth
and
i
arose
and
took
a
knife
and
throwing
myself
upon
her
bosom
plunged
the
knife
into
her
i
then
cut
off
her
head
and
limbs
and
put
them
in
the
basket
in
haste
and
covered
them
with
the
izÃr
over
which
i
laid
a
piece
of
carpet
then
i
put
the
basket
in
the
chest
and
having
locked
this
conveyed
it
on
my
mule
and
threw
it
with
my
own
hands
into
the
tigris8

and
now
continued
the
young
man
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
o
prince
of
the
faithful
to
hasten
my
death
in
retaliation
for
her
murder
as
i
dread
otherwise
her
appeal
for
vengeance
upon
me
on
the
day
of
resurrection9
for
when
i
had
thrown
her
into
the
tigris
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
i
returned
to
my
house
and
found
my
eldest
boy
crying
though
he
knew
not
what
i
had
done
to
his
mother
so
i
said
to
him
what
maketh
thee
cryâand
he
answered
i
took
one
of
the
apples
that
my
mother
had
and
went
down
with
it
into
the
street
to
play
with
my
brothers
and
a
tall
black
slave
snatched
it
from
me
and
said
to
me
whence
came
this
to
thee
i
answered
him
my
father
made
a
journey
for
it
and
brought
it
from
el-baárah
for
the
sake
of
my
mother
for
she
is
sick
he
bought
three
apples
for
three
pieces
of
goldâbut
he
took
it
from
me
and
beat
me
and
went
away
with
it
and
i
am
afraid
that
my
mother
may
beat
me
on
account
of
the
appleâwhen
i
heard
my
sons
story
i
discovered
that
the
slave
had
forged
a
lie
against
the
daughter
of
my
uncle
and
found
that
she
had
been
killed
unjustly
and
as
i
was
weeping228
bitterly
for
what
i
had
done
this
sheykh
my
uncle
and
her
father
came
to
me
and
i
informed
him
of
the
event
and
he
seated
himself
by
me
and
wept
we
wept
until
midnight
and
continued
our
mourning
for
her
five
days
ceasing
not
to
the
present
day
to
bewail
her
death
by
the
honour
of
thine
ancestors
therefore
hasten
my
death
to
retaliate
her
murder
upon
me

the
khaleefeh
wondered
at
the
young
mans
story
and
said
by
allah
i
will
not
put
to
death
any
but
the
wicked
slave
for
the
young
man
is
excusable
then
looking
towards
jaáºfar
he
said
to
him
bring
before
me
this
wicked
slave
who
hath
been
the
cause
of
the
catastrophe
or
if
thou
bring
him
not
thou
shalt
be
put
to
death
in
his
stead
so
the
wezeer
departed
weeping
and
saying
whence
shall
i
bring
him
not
every
time
that
the
jar
is
struck
doth
it
escape
being
broken
i
have
no
stratagem
to
employ
in
this
affair
but
he
who
delivered
me
in
the
first
case
may
deliver
me
in
the
second
by
allah
i
will
not
go
out
from
my
house
for
three
days
and
the
truth
whose
perfection
be
extolled
will
do
what
he
willethâso
he
remained
in
his
house
three
days
and
on
the
fourth
day
he
caused
the
áÃáee
to
be
brought
and
made
his
testamentary
arrangements
and
as
he
was
bidding
farewell
to
his
children
and
weeping
lo
the
messenger
of
the
khaleefeh
came
and
said
to
him
the
prince
of
the
faithful
is
in
a
most
violent
rage
and
hath
sent
me
to
thee
and
he
hath
sworn
that
this
day
shall
not
pass
until
thou
art
put
to
death
if
thou
do
not
bring
to
him
the
slave

on
hearing
this
jaáºfar
wept
and
his
children
wept
with
him
and
when
he
had
bidden
them
all
farewell
except
his
youngest
daughter
he
approached
her
for
the
same
purpose
he
loved
her
more
than
all
his
other
children
and
he
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
and
wept
at
the
thought
of
his
separation
from
her
but
in
doing
this
he
felt
something
round
in
her
pocket
and
said
to
her
what
is
in
thy
pocket
she
answered
o
my
father
it
is
an
apple
our
slave
reyáan10
brought
it
and
i
have
had
it
four
days
he
would
not
give
it
me
until
he
had
received
from
me
two
pieces
of
goldâat
this
mention
of
the
slave
and
the
apple
jaáºfar
rejoiced
and
exclaimed
o
ready
dispeller
of
trouble11âand
immediately
he
ordered
that
the
slave
should
be
brought
before
him
he
was
therefore
brought
in
and
he
said
to
him
whence
came
this
appleâo
my
master
he
answered
i
went
out
five
days
ago
and
entering
one
of
the
by-streets
of
the
city
i
saw
some
children
playing
and
one
of
them
had
this
apple
and
i
snatched
it
from
him
and
beat
him
and
he
cried
and229
said
that
belongs
to
my
mother
and
she
is
sick
she
wanted
my
father
to
bring
her
an
apple
and
he
made
a
journey
to
el-baárah
and
brought
back
for
her
three
apples
which
he
bought
for
three
pieces
of
gold
and
i
took
this
to
play
with
itâthen
he
cried
again
but
paying
no
regard
to
him
i
took
it
away
and
brought
it
hither
and
my
little
mistress
bought
it
of
me
for
two
pieces
of
goldâwhen
he
heard
this
story
jaáºfar
was
filled
with
wonder
at
discovering
that
this
distressing
event
and
the
murder
of
the
damsel
had
been
occasioned
by
his
slave
and
he
took
the
slave
and
went
with
him
to
the
khaleefeh
who
ordered
that
the
story
should
be
committed
to
writing
and
published

the
wezeer
finding
the
apple
jaáºfar
then
said
to
him
wonder
not
o
prince
of
the
faithful
at
his
tale
for
it
is
not
more
extraordinary
than
the
story
of
the
wezeer230
noor-ed-deen
and
shems-ed-deen
his
brotherâwhat
story
said
the
khaleefeh
can
be
more
wonderful
than
thisâo
prince
of
the
faithful
replied
jaáºfar
i
will
not
relate
it
to
thee
unless
on
the
condition
that
thou
exempt
my
slave
from
the
punishment
of
death
the
khaleefeh
said
i
give
thee
his
bloodâand
jaáºfar
thereupon
commenced
the
relation
of
the
story
as
followsâ

the
story
of
noor-ed-deen
and
his
son
and
of
shems-ed-deen
and
his
daughter

know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
there
was
in
cairo12
a
suláÃn13
just
and
beneficent
who
had
a
wise
and
well-informed
wezeer
possessing
a
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
of
the
art
of
government
this
minister
was
an
aged
man
and
he
had
two
sons
like
two
moons
the
name
of
the
elder
was
shems-ed-deen
and
that
of
the
younger
noor-ed-deen14
and
the
latter
was
more
distinguished
than
the
former
by
handsomeness
and
comeliness
there
was
no
one
in
his
day
more
handsome
so
that
the
fame
of
his
charms
spread
through
the
neighbouring
regions
and
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
parts
travelled
to
his
country
merely
to
obtain
a
sight
of
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
father
died
and
the
suláÃn
mourned
for
him
and
turning
his
regards
towards
the
two
sons
took
them
into
his
favour
invested
them
with
robes
of
honour
and
said
to
them
ye
two
are
instated
in
your
fathers
officeâat
which
they
rejoiced
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
they
observed
the
ceremonies
of
mourning15
for
their
father
during
a
period
of
a
whole
month
and
entered
upon
the
office
of
wezeers
each
of
them
discharging
the
duties
of
this
station
for
a
week
at
a
time
and
whenever
the
suláÃn
had
a
desire
to
go
forth
on
a
journey
he
took
one
of
them
with
him

now
it
happened
one
night
that
the
suláÃn
purposed
commencing
a
journey
on
the
following
morning
and
it
was
the
turn
of
the
elder
wezeer
to
accompany
him
and
as
the
two
brothers
were
conversing
together
that
night
the
elder
said
o
my
brother
it
is
my
wish
that
we
should
both
marry
on
one
nightâdo
o
my
brother
as
thou
desirest
answered
the
younger
and
i
will
comply
with
that
which
thou
shalt
say
so
they
agreed
to
do
this
the
elder
then
said
to
his
brother
if
god
so
decree
that
we
obtain
the
betrothal
of
two
maidens
and
accomplish
our
marriage
on
the
same
night
and
they231
give
birth
to
children
on
the
same
day
and
god
will
that
thy
wife
have
a
son
and
my
wife
have
a
daughter
we
will
marry
them
to
each
other
for
they
will
be
cousinsâand
what
o
my
brother
said
noor-ed-deen
wilt
thou
require
of
my
son
as
the
dowry
of
thy
daughter
he
answered
i
will
require
of
thy
son
as
the
dowry
of
my
daughter
three
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
three
gardens
and
three
farms
for
if
the
young
man
make
any
other
contract
than
this
it
will
not
be
proper
but
when
noor-ed-deen
heard
this
proposal
he
exclaimed
what
is
this
dowry
that
thou
imposest
upon
my
son
dost
thou
not
know
that
we
are
two
brothers
and
that
we
are
both
wezeers
of
one
dignity
it
were
incumbent
on
thee
to
offer
thy
daughter
to
my
son
as
a
free
gift
without
any
dowry
for
thou
knowest
that
the
male
is
more
honourable
than
the
female
and
my
child
is
a
male
and
by
him
shall
our
memory
be
preserved
not
by
thy
daughterâwhat
sayest
thou
of
her
asked
his
brotherâthat
our
memory
will
not
be
preserved
by
her
among
the
nobles
answered
noor-ed-deen
but
thou
desirest
added
he
to
act
with
me
according
to
the
opinion
of
him
who
saith
if
thou
desire
to
drive
away
a
person
who
would
buy
demand
of
him
a
high
priceâi
see
thee
replied
shems-ed-deen
to
have
committed
a
fault
in
making
thy
son
more
honourable
than
my
daughter
thou
art
doubtless
deficient
in
judgment
and
destitute
of
good
disposition
seeing
that
thou
mentionest
the
partnership
in
the
office
of
wezeer
when
i
admitted
thee
not
to
share
it
with
me
excepting
in
my
pity
for
thee
and
that
thou
mightest
assist
me
but
talk
as
thou
wilt
since
thou
hast
said
this
by
allah
i
will
not
marry
my
daughter
to
thy
son
though
thou
offer
me
her
weight
in
goldâon
hearing
these
words
of
his
brother
noor-ed-deen
was
enraged
and
said
i
will
not
marry
my
son
to
thy
daughterâi
will
not
accept
him
as
a
husband
for
her
replied
shems-ed-deen
and
if
i
were
not
purposing
a
journey
i
would
do
to
thee
deeds
that
should
serve
as
warnings
to
others
however
when
i
return
god
will
do
what
he
willethâwhen
noor-ed-deen
heard
this
he
was
full
of
anger
and
became
unconscious
of
existence
but
he
concealed
his
feelings
and
each
of
the
two
brothers
passed
the
night
apart
from
the
other
and
in
the
morning
the
suláÃn
set
out
on
his
journey
and
crossing
over
to
the
island16
proceeded
towards
the
pyramids
accompanied
by
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen

noor-ed-deen
passed
that
night
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
rage
and
when
the
morning
came
he
arose
and
having
performed
the
morning-prayers
went
to
his
closet
and
took
out
from
it
a
pair
of
small
saddle-bags
which
he
filled
with
gold
and
as
he
reflected
upon
the
words
of232
his
brother
and
the
contempt
which
he
had
shewn
him
and
the
pride
that
he
had
manifested
towards
him
he
repeated
these
versesâ

travel
thou
wilt
find
a
friend
in
the
place
of
him
thou
leavest
and
fatigue
thyself
for
by
labour
are
the
sweets
of
life
obtained
to
a
man
of
intelligence
and
education
there
is
no
glory
in
a
constant
residence
therefore
quit
thy
native
place
and
go
abroad
i
have
observed
that
the
stagnation
of
water
corrupteth
it
if
it
floweth
it
becometh
sweet
but
otherwise
it
doth
not
if
the
full
moon
never
set
the
eye
of
the
contemplative
would
not
on
every
occasion
pay
regard
to
it
the
lions
if
they
left
not
the
forest
would
capture
no
prey
and
the
arrow
if
it
quitted
not
the
bow
would
not
strike
the
mark
the
grains
of
gold
upon
their
native
bed
are
regarded
as
mere
dust
and
the
aloes-wood
where
it
groweth
is
a
kind
of
firewood
if
exported
it
becometh
an
object
of
high
demand
but
if
not
it
attaineth
no
kind
of
distinction
he
then
ordered
one
of
his
young
men
to
saddle
for
him
a
dapple
mule
tall
and
of
quick
pace
and
he
did
so
placing
upon
her
a
saddle
adorned
with
gold
with
stirrups
of
indian
steel
and
housings
of
the
velvet
of
iápahÃn
and
she
resembled
a
bride
displayed
before
her
husband
he
ordered
him
also
to
place
upon
her
a
carpet
of
silk
and
a
prayer-carpet17
and
to
put
the
saddle-bags
beneath
the
latter
and
when
this
was
done
he
said
to
the
young
man
and
the
slaves
i
have
a
desire
to
take
a
ride
for
my
amusement
outside
the
city
towards
the
province
of
áalyoob
and
shall
be
absent
three
nights
and
let
none
of
you
follow
me
for
my
heart
is
contracted

the
pyramids
having
thus
said
he
mounted
his
mule
in
haste
and
taking
with
him
a
small
supply
of
food
departed
from
the
city
turning
his
face
towards
the
open
country
the
hour
of
noon
overtook
him
not
until233
he
entered
the
city
of
bilbeys
where
he
alighted
to
repose
himself
and
rest
his
mule
and
ate
after
which
he
took
from
this
place
what
he
required
for
himself
and
some
provender
for
his
mule
and
having
placed
these
provisions
upon
her
went
forth
again
into
the
plain
and
before
noon
on
the
second
following
day
he
entered
jerusalem18
here
he
alighted
again
and
rested
himself
and
his
beast
and
ate
he
then
placed
his
saddle-bags
under
his
head
and
spread
his
carpet
and
slept
still
overcome
by
anger
he
passed
the
night
in
this
place
and
in
the
morning
he
remounted
and
he
continued
to
urge
on
his
mule
until
he
arrived
at
aleppo19
where
he
alighted
at
a
áhÃn
and
remained
three
days
to
give
rest
to
himself
and
his
mule
and
to
enjoy
the
air
of
the
place
which
having
done
he
determined
to
prosecute
234his
journey
and
mounted
his
mule
and
went
forth
he
knew
not
whither
to
direct
his
course
but
travelled
on
until
he
arrived
at
the
city
of
el-baárah
and
scarcely
was
he
aware
that
the
night
had
overtaken
him
when
he
alighted
there
at
a
khÃn
where
he
took
off
the
saddle-bags
from
the
mule
and
spread
the
prayer-carpet
committing
the
mule
with
her
equipage
to
the
care
of
the
door-keeper
and
ordering
him
to
walk
her
about
a
little

the
mule
of
noor-ed-deen
the
door-keeper
did
so
and
it
happened
that
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
sitting
at
a
window
of
his
palace
saw
the
mule
and
observing
her
costly
equipage
thought
that
she
must
belong
to
some
wezeer
or
king
and
as
he
attentively
regarded
her
he
was
surprised
and
said
to
one
of
his
pages
bring
before
me
that
door-keeper
so
the
page
went
and
brought
him
and
the
door-keeper
approaching
kissed
the
ground
before
him
the
wezeer
who
was
an
aged
person
then
said
to
this
man
who
is
the
owner
of
this
mule
and
what
is
his
appearanceâo
my
lord
answered
the
door-keeper
her
owner
is
a
young
man
of
elegant
person
of
the
sons
of
the
merchants
and
of
a
dignified
and
grave
aspect
on
hearing
this
the
wezeer
arose
and
mounting
his
horse20
went
to
the
khÃn
and
introduced
himself
to
the
young
man
who
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
approaching
rose
to
meet
him
and
embraced
him
the
wezeer
after
he
had
alighted
from
his
horse
saluted
him
and
welcomed
him
and
seating
him
by
his
side
said
to
him
whence
o
my
son
hast
thou
come
and
for
what
purposeâo
my
lord
answered
noor-ed-deen
i
have
come
from
the
city
of
cairo
my
father
was
wezeer
there
and
he
hath
departed
to
receive
the
mercy
of
godâand
he
informed
him
of
all
that
had
happened
to
him
from
first
to
last
adding
i
have
determined
that
i
will
not
return
until
i
shall
have
seen
all
the
cities
and
countries
of
the
worldâo
my
son
replied
the
wezeer
obey
not
the
suggestions
of
thy
mind
lest
thou
expose
thyself
to
destruction
for
the
countries
are
waste
and
i
fear
on
thy
account
the
issues
of
fortune
so
saying
he
ordered
that
the
saddle-bags
should
be
placed
again
on
the
mule
together
with
the
carpet
of
silk
and
the
prayer-carpet
and
took
noor-ed-deen
with
him
to
his
house
where
he
lodged
him
in
an
elegant
apartment
and
treated
him
with
honour
and
kindness
and
conceiving
a
strong
affection
for
him
said
to
him
o
my
son
i
have
become
an
old
man
and
i
have
no
male
child
god
however
hath
blessed
me
with
a
daughter
who
resembleth
thee
in
comeliness
and
i
have
rejected
many
persons
who
have
been
her
suitors
but
now
love
for
thee
hath
entered
my
heart
wilt
thou
then
take
my
daughter
as
thy
hand-maid
to
serve
thee
and235
be
her
husband
if
thou
consent
to
this
i
will
go
up
to
the
suláÃn
of
el-baárah
and
will
say
to
him
this
is
the
son
of
my
brotherâand
i
will
introduce
thee
to
him
that
i
may
make
thee
wezeer
in
my
place
and
i
will
remain
in
my
house
for
i
am
now
agedânoor-ed-deen
on
hearing
this
proposal
of
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
hung
down
his
head
and
then
answered
i
hear
and
obey

noor-ed-deen
after
the
bath
the
wezeer
rejoiced
at
his
assent
and
ordered
his
servants
to
prepare
for
him
a
repast
and
to
decorate
the
great
saloon21
which
was
furnished
for
the
reception
of
the
chiefs
of
the
emeers
he
then
called
together
his
friends
and
invited
the
great
officers
of
the
state
and
the
merchants
of
el-baárah
and
when
they
had
come
into
his
presence
he
said
to
them
i
had
a
brother
who
was
wezeer
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
god
blessed
him
with
two
sons
and
me
as
ye
know
he
hath
blessed
with
a
daughter
now
my
brother
enjoined
me
to
marry
my
daughter
to
one
of
his
sons
and
i
consented
to
do
so
and
when
she
attained
a
fit
age
for
marriage
he
sent
to
me
one
of
his
sons
who
is
this
young
man
here
present
as
soon
therefore
as
he
had
come
i
desired
to
perform
the
marriage-contract
between
him
and
my
daughter
and
that
he
should
introduce
himself
to
her
here
in
my
houseâexcellently
hast
thou
done
they
replied
they
then
drank
sherbet
of
sugar
and
the
pages
sprinkled
rose-water
upon
them
and
they
departed
after
which
the
wezeer
ordered
his
servants
to
conduct
noor-en-deen
to
the
bath
and
gave
him
a
suit
of
his
best
clothes22
and
sent
to
him
the
napkins
and
cups
and
perfuming-vessels
and
everything
else
that
he
required
so
when
he
came
out
from
the
bath
he
put
on
the
suit
of
clothes
and
appeared
like
the
full
moon
and
he
mounted
his
mule
and
returning
to
the
palace
alighted
and
presented
himself
before
the
wezeer
and
kissed
his
hand
and
the
wezeer
welcomed
him
saying
arise
and
introduce
thyself
this
night
to
thy236
wife
and
to-morrow
i
will
go
up
with
thee
to
the
suláÃn
and
i
pray
that
god
may
bless
thee
with
every
kind
of
happiness
noor-ed-deen
therefore
arose
and
went
to
his
wife
the
daughter
of
the
wezeerâthus
did
it
happen
to
noor-ed-deen

as
to
his
brother
he
continued
a
while
journeying
with
the
suláÃn
and
when
he
returned
and
found
not
his
brother
he
inquired
of
the
servants
respecting
him
and
they
answered
on
the
day
of
thy
departure
with
the
suláÃn
he
mounted
his
mule
caparisoned
as
for
a
procession
of
state
and
said
i
am
going
towards
the
province
of
áalyoob
and
shall
be
absent
a
day
or
two
days
for
my
heart
is
contracted
therefore
let
none
of
you
follow
meâand
from
the
day
on
which
he
went
forth
to
the
present
day
we
have
heard
no
tidings
of
him
upon
this
the
heart
of
shems-ed-deen
was
troubled
at
the
separation
of
his
brother
and
he
grieved
excessively
for
his
loss
saying
within
himself
the
cause
of
this
is
nothing
else
than
my
having
spoken
harshly
to
him
in
my
conversation
on
the
night
before
my
departure
with
the
suláÃn
and
probably
his
mind
was
disturbed
and
he
went
on
a
journey
i
must
therefore
send
after
him
he
then
went
up
and
related
this
event
to
the
suláÃn
who
wrote
letters
and
sent
them
to
his
vicegerents
in
all
the
provinces
but
noor-ed-deen
had
traversed
distant
regions
during
the
absence
of
his
brother
with
the
suláÃn
therefore
the
messengers
when
they
had
gone
with
the
letters
returned
without
having
obtained
any
information
respecting
him
so
shems-ed-deen
despaired
of
his
brother
and
said
i
have
enraged
my
brother
by
what
i
said
to
him
concerning
the
marriage
of
the
children
would
that
i
had
not
done
so
this
was
not
occasioned
but
by
my
want
of
sense
and
judgmentâand
soon
after
this
he
demanded
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
merchants
of
cairo
and
performed
the
marriage-contract
between
himself
and
her
and
introduced
himself
to
her
and
it
happened
that
the
night
when
this
event
took
place
was
the
same
night
on
which
noor-ed-deen
introduced
himself
to
his
wife
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
this
being
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
that
he
might
execute
his
decree
upon
his
creatures

the
event
was
as
they
both
had
said
for
it
came
to
pass
that
the
two
wives
conceived
by
them
the
wife
of
shems-ed-deen
the
wezeer
of
egypt
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
than
whom
there
was
not
seen
in
that
country
one
more
beautiful
and
the
wife
of
noor-ed-deen
gave
birth
to
a
son
one
more
beautiful
than
whom
was
not
seen
in
his
time
as
the
poet
hath
said237â

if
beauty
came
to
be
compared
with
him
it
would
hang
down
its
head
in
shame
or
if
it
were
said
o
beauty
hast
thou
seen
the
likeâit
would
answer
the
equal
of
this
i
have
not
so
they
named
him
áasan23
and
on
the
seventh
day
after
his
birth
they
made
entertainments
and
spread
repasts
such
as
were
fit
for
the
sons
of
kings24
after
which
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
took
with
him
noor-ed-deen
and
went
up
with
him
to
the
suláÃn
and
when
he
came
into
his
presence
he
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
noor-ed-deen
being
eloquent
in
tongue
and
firm
of
heart
and
comely
in
person
and
in
actions
recited
these
words
of
the
poetâ

this
is
he
whose
justice
extendeth
to
all
men
and
who
hath
overrun
and
subdued
every
region
be
thankful
for
his
benefits
for
they
are
not
mere
benefits
but
they
are
strings
of
jewels
on
the
necks
of
his
people
and
kiss
his
fingers
for
they
are
not
mere
fingers
but
they
are
the
keys
of
the
supplies
of
providence
the
suláÃn
treated
them
both
with
honour
and
having
thanked
noor-ed-deen
for
his
address
said
to
his
wezeer
who
is
this
young
man
the
wezeer
therefore
related
to
him
his
story
from
beginning
to
end
and
added
this
is
the
son
of
my
brotherâhow
is
it
said
the
suláÃn
that
he
is
the
son
of
thy
brother
and
we
have
not
before
heard
of
him
the
wezeer
answered
o
our
lord
the
suláÃn
i
had
a
brother
who
was
wezeer
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
he
died
leaving
two
sons
the
elder
succeeded
to
his
fathers
office
as
wezeer
and
this
his
younger
son
came
to
me
and
i
swore
that
i
would
not
marry
my
daughter
to
any
but
him
so
when
he
came
i
married
him
to
her
he
is
a
young
man
and
i
am
now
aged
my
hearing
is
impaired
and
my
judgment
faileth
it
is
my
wish
therefore
that
our
lord
the
suláÃn
would
instate
him
in
my
office
seeing
that
he
is
the
son
of
my
brother
and
the
husband
of
my
daughter
and
a
person
worthy
of
the
dignity
of
wezeer
for
he
is
endowed
with
knowledge
and
judgmentâthe
suláÃn
upon
this
looked
towards
him
and
being
pleased
with
him
approved
of
the
advice
of
the
wezeer
that
he
should
promote
him
to
that
office
so
he
bestowed
it
upon
him
and
ordered
that
a
magnificent
dress
of
honour
should
be
given
to
him
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
mules
upon
which
he
was
himself
accustomed
to
ride
allotting
him
also
supplies
and
salaries
and
noor-ed-deen
kissed
the
hand
of
the
suláÃn
and
descended
with
his
father-in-law
to
their
house
both
in
high
delight
and
saying
verily
the
birth
of
this
child
is
fortunate
on
the
following
day
noor-ed-deen
went
again
to
the
king
and
kissed
the
ground
and
the
suláÃn
ordered
him
to
sit
in
the
place
of238
the
wezeer
so
he
sat
and
occupied
himself
with
the
affairs
of
his
office
and
examined
the
cases
of
the
people
and
their
suits
according
to
the
custom
of
wezeers
and
the
suláÃn
observing
him
was
surprised
at
his
conduct
and
the
acuteness
of
his
understanding
and
his
good
judgment
he
attentively
considered
his
qualities
and
loved
him
and
advanced
him
in
his
favour
and
when
the
court
was
dissolved
noor-ed-deen
returned
to
his
house
and
related
what
had
passed
to
his
father-in-law
who
was
rejoiced
at
hearing
it

the
old
wezeer
instructing
his
grandchild
the
old
wezeer
ceased
not
to
superintend
the
rearing
of
the
child
who
was
named
áasan
for
many
days
while
noor-ed-deen
was
constantly
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
his
office
so
that
he
left
not
the
suláÃn
by
day
nor
by
night
and
the
king
increased
his
salaries
and
supplies
until
his
circumstances
became
ample
he
had
ships
which
made
voyages
under
his
orders
with
merchandise
and
other
things
and
he
founded
numerous
estates
and
made
water-wheels25
and
gardens
thus
did
he
until
his
son
áasan
was
four
years
of
age
when
the
old
wezeer
the
father
of
his
wife
died
and
he
conveyed
his
corpse
with
great
pomp
and
decently
deposited
it
in
the
earth
he
then
turned
his
thoughts
towards
the
education
of
his
son
and
when
the
child
had
gained
strength
he
brought
him
a
tutor
to
teach
him
in
his
own
house
charging
him
to
instruct
him
and
educate
him
well
and
the
tutor
did
so
and
taught
him
various
useful
sciences
after
he
had
passed
some
years
in
learning
the
áur-Ãn
áasan
meanwhile
increased
in
loveliness
and
beauty
and
elegance
of
person
the
tutor
continued239
to
educate
him
in
his
fathers
palace
and
from
the
time
that
he
arrived
at
adolescence
he
went
not
out
of
the
wezeers
palace
until
his
father
took
him
one
day
and
having
clad
him
in
one
of
the
richest
of
his
dresses
mounted
him
on
one
of
his
best
mules
and
conducted
him
to
the
suláÃn
and
introduced
him
when
the
king
beheld
áasan
bedr-ed-deen26
the
son
of
the
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
he
was
astonished
at
his
beauty
and
the
people
when
he
passed
by
them
for
the
first
time
going
up
with
his
father
to
the
king
were
amazed
at
his
surpassing
beauty
and
loveliness
and
elegance
of
person
the
suláÃn
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
loved
him
and
bestowed
marks
of
favour
upon
him
and
said
to
his
father
o
wezeer
thou
must
bring
him
with
thee
every
day
the
wezeer
answered
i
hear
and
obeyâand
returned
with
his
son
to
his
abode
and
he
continued
every
day
to
go
up
with
him
to
the
suláÃn
until
the
youth
attained
the
age
of
fifteen
years

his
father
the
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
then
fell
sick
and
called
him
into
his
presence
and
said
to
him
o
my
son
know
that
this
world
is
a
perishable
abode
and
the
world
to
come
is
an
everlasting
abode
i
wish
to
give
thee
some
precepts
and
do
thou
understand
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
thee
and
incline
thy
heart
to
itâand
he
began
to
counsel
him
respecting
the
proper
mode
of
conducting
himself
in
society
and
the
due
management
of
his
affairs
and
when
he
had
done
so
he
reflected
upon
his
brother
and
his
native
place
and
country
and
wept
at
the
thought
of
his
separation
from
those
he
loved
his
tears
flowing
and
he
said
o
my
son
hear
my
words
i
have
a
brother27
in
cairo
and
i
quitted
him
and
departed
against
his
willâhe
then
took
a
piece
of
paper28
and
wrote
upon
it
all
that
had
happened
to
him
from
first
to
last
together
with
the
date
of
his
marriage
and
introduction
to
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
and
the
date
of
his
arrival
at
el-baárah
and
his
interview
with
its
wezeer
and
having
added
some
strict
admonition
he
said
to
his
son
keep
this
charge
for
the
paper
on
which
it
is
written
containeth
an
account
of
thine
origin
and
thy
rank
and
lineage
and
if
any
evil
accident
befall
thee
repair
to
cairo
and
inquire
for
thine
uncle
and
salute
him
and
inform
him
that
i
died
in
a
strange
land
ardently
desiring
that
i
could
see
him
therefore
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
took
the
paper
and
having
folded
it
and
wrapped
it
in
a
piece
of
waxed
cloth29
sewed
it
between
the
lining
and
the
outer
cloth
of
his
cap30
and
wept
for
his
father
that
he
should
be
parted
from
him
in
his
youth

noor-ed-deen
then
said
to
his
son31
i
charge
thee
that
thou
be240
not
familiar
with
any
one
for
in
retirement

security
divinely
gifted
was
the
poet
who
saidâ

there
is
none
in
thy
time
whose
friendship
thou
shouldst
covet
nor
any
intimate
who
when

apart
and
rely
upon
no
man
i
have
given
thee
in
these
words
good
advice
and
sufficient
accustom
thyself
to
taciturnity
occupy
thyself
with
thine
own
affairs
and
use
not
many
words
for
the
poet
saithâ

taciturnity
is
an
ornament
and
in
silence
is
security
therefore
when
thou
speakest
be
not
loquacious
for
if
thou
repent
once
of
thy
silence
thou
wilt
assuredly
repent
many
times
of
thy
speech
beware
of
drinking
wine
for
it
is
the
source
of
every
kind
of
mischief
the
poet32
saith
on
this
subjectâ

i
have
abandoned
wine
and
those
who
drink
it
and
have
become
the
friend
of
such
as
condemn
it
wine
leadeth
astray
from
the
path
of
rectitude
and
openeth
the
doors
to
evil
hate
no
man
and
oppress
none
for
oppression
is
base
the
poet
saithâ

oppress
not
if
thou
hast
the
power
to
do
so
for
oppression
will
eventually
bring
thee
repentance
thine
eye
will
sleep
while
the
oppressed
wakeful
will
call
for
vengeance
upon
thee
and
the
eye
of
god
sleepeth
not
despise
thy
wealth
but
not
thyself
yet
bestow
not
wealth
save
upon
him
who
deserveth
it
if
thou
keep
it
it
will
keep
thee
but
if
thou
squander
it
it
will
ruin
thee
and
then
wilt
thou
need
the
assistance
of
the
least
of
mankind
it
hath
been
said
by
the
poetâ

when
my
wealth
faileth
no
friend
assisteth
me
but
when
it
aboundeth
all
men
are
my
friends
how
many
enemies
for
the
sake
of
wealth
have
consorted
with
me
and
my
companion
in
the
time
of
want
hath
abandoned
me
in
this
manner
he
continued
to
admonish
his
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
until
his
spirit
departed
the
house
became
a
scene
of
mourning
and
the
suláÃn
and
all
the
emeers
grieved
for
him
and
they
buried
him
they
continued
their
mourning
during
a
period
of
two
months
and
the
son
of
noor-ed-deen
rode
not
out
nor
went
to
the
court
nor
presented
himself
before
the
suláÃn
and
the
king
instated
one
of
the
chamberlains
in
his
place
and
appointed
a
new
wezeer
in
the
place
of
his
father
and
ordered
this
wezeer
to
put
seals
upon
all
the
houses
of
noor-ed-deen
and
upon
his
wealth
and
all
his
buildings
and
other
possessions33
so
the
new
wezeer
went
with
the
chamber241lains
to
the
house
of
the
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
to
seal
its
door
and
to
arrest
his
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
bring
him
before
the
suláÃn
that
he
might
do
to
him
what
his
judgment
required
but
there
was
among
the
troops
one
of
the
memlooks
of
the
deceased
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
and
he
could
not
endure
that
the
son
of
his
master
should
be
thus
treated
he
therefore
repaired
to
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
whom
he
found
with
downcast
head
and
mourning
heart
on
account
of
the
death
of
his
father
and
acquainted
him
with
what
had
passed
áasan
asked
him
will
the
execution
of
the
order
be
delayed
long
enough
for
me
to
enter
my
house34
and
take
somewhat
of
my
worldly
possessions
by
which
to
obtain
support
during
my
exile
but
the
memlook
answered
save
thyselfâand
when
áasan
heard
these
words
he
covered
his
head
with
the
skirt
of
his
robe
and
going
forth
on
foot
fled
of
the
city
and
he
heard
the
people
saying
the
suláÃn
hath
sent
the
new
wezeer
to
the
house
of
the
deceased
wezeer
to
seal
his
wealth
and
other
possessions
and
to
arrest
his
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
bring
him
before
him
that
he
may
put
him
to
deathâand
the
people
were
mourning
for
him
on
account
of
his
beauty
and
loveliness
so
when
he
heard
what
they
said
he
took
a
course
that
he
had
not
intended
and
not
knowing
whither
to
go
walked
on
until
destiny
urged
him
to
the
tomb
of
his
father

noor-ed-deen
and
his
son
entering
the
burial-ground
he
bent
his
way
among
the
tombs
until
he
seated
himself
at
that
of
his
father
where
he
removed
his
skirt
from
over
his
head
and
as
he
was
sitting
there
a
jew
of
el-baárah
approached
and
said
to
him
wherefore
o
my
master
do
i
see
thee
thus
changed
he
answered
i
was
just
now
sleeping
and
i
beheld
my
father
reproaching
me
for
having
failed
to
visit
his
tomb242
wherefore
i
rose
in
alarm
fearing
that
the
day
would
pass
without
my
visiting
it
and
so
the
occurrence
would
distress
me
the
jew
then
said
to
him
o
my
master
thy
father
despatched
some
vessels
with
merchandise
and
some
of
them
have
returned
and
it
is
my
wish
to
purchase
of
thee
the
cargo
of
every
vessel
that
hath
arrived
for
a
thousand
pieces
of
goldâand
so
saying
he
took
out
a
purse
filled
with
gold
and
counted
out
from
it
a
thousand
pieces
which
he
paid
to
áasan
the
son
of
the
wezeer
and
said
to
him
write
me
a
paper
and
seal
it
so
áasan
took
a
paper
and
wrote
upon
it
the
writer
of
this
paper
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
the
son
of
the
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
hath
sold
to
the
jew
such
a
one
the
whole
cargo
of
every
one
of
his
fathers
vessels
that
hath
returned
from
her
voyage
for
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
hath
received
the
price
in
advance
and
after
he
had
taken
a
copy35
of
it
the
jew
went
away
with
the
paper
and
áasan
wept
reflecting
upon
his
former
state
of
dignity
and
favour
at
length
the
night
closed
in
upon
him
and
sleep
overtook
him
and
he
remained
asleep
at
his
fathers
tomb
until
the
moon
rose
when
his
head
rolled
from
the
tomb
and
he
lay
and
slept
on
his
back
his
face
shining
in
the
moonlight

bedr-ed-deen
at
his
fathers
tomb
now
the
burial-ground
was
inhabited
by
believing
jinn
and
a
jinneeyeh
coming
forth
saw
the
face
of
áasan
as
he
lay
asleep
and
when
she
beheld
him
was
surprised
at
his
beauty
and
loveliness
and
exclaimed
extolled
be
allahs
perfection
this
youth
is
like
none
but
the
virgins
of
paradiseâshe
then
soared
into
the
air
to
perform
her
accustomed
circuits
and
saw
an
efreet
on
his
flight
she
saluted
him
and
he
returned
her
salutation
and
she
said
to
him
whence
comest
thou
he
answered
from
cairoâand
she
said
to
him
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
behold
the
beauty
of
the
youth
who
is
sleeping
in
the
burial-ground
he
replied
yes
so
they
went
together
and
when
they
had
descended
into
the
burial-ground
she
said
to
him
hast
thou
seen
in
the
course
of
thy
life
a
person
like
thisâand
the
efreet
looked
upon
him
and
exclaimed
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
unto
whom
none
is
to
be
compared
but
o
my
sister
he
added
if
thou
desire
i
will
relate
to
thee
what
i
have
seenâtell
me
she
replied
so
he
said
i
have
seen
a
person
resembling
this
youth
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
that
person
is
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
the
king
had
heard
of
her
and
demanded
her
of
her
father
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen
in
marriage
but
he
answered
him
o
our
lord
the
suláÃn
accept
my
excuse
and
pity
my
grief
for
thou
knowest
that
my
brother
noor-ed-deen
departed
from
us
and
we
know
not243
where
he
is
and
that
he
shared
with
me
the
office
of
wezeer
and
the
cause
of
his
departure
was
this
that
i
was
sitting
conversing
with
him
on
the
subject
of
marriage
and
he
was
angry
with
me
and
in
anger
went
awayâand
he
related
to
the
king
all
that
had
passed
between
them
adding
this
was
the
cause
of
his
indignation
and
i
have
been
under
an
oath
that
i
will
not
marry
my
daughter
to
any
but
the
son
of
my
brother
from
the
day
that
her
mother
gave
birth
to
her
and
that
was
about
fifteen
years
ago
and
lately
i
heard
that
my
brother
had
married
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
and
obtained
a
son
by
her
and
i
will
not
marry
my
daughter
to
any
but
him
in
honour
of
my
brother
after
i
had
heard
this
i
recorded
the244
date
of
my
marriage
and
of
my
wifes
conception
and
of
the
birth
of
this
daughter
she
is
intended
for
the
son
of
her
uncle
and
of
other
maidens
there
are
plentyâbut
when
the
suláÃn
heard
these
words
of
the
wezeer
he
was
violently
enraged
and
said
how
is
it
that
such
a
one
as
myself
demandeth
in
marriage
a
daughter
from
one
like
thee
and
thou
withholdest
her
from
him
and
excusest
thyself
by
an
absurd
pretext
by
my
head
i
will
not
marry
her
but
to
one
of
less
consideration
than
myself
in
scorn
of
thy
prideâand
the
king
had
a
humpbacked
groom
with
a
hump
before
and
a
hump
behind
and
he
ordered
him
to
be
brought
and
affianced
him
to
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
commanding
that
he
should
introduce
himself
to
her
this
night
and
be
conducted
in
pompous
procession
i
left
him
in
the
midst
of
the
memlooks
of
the
suláÃn
who
were
surrounding
him
with
lighted
candles
in
their
hands
laughing
at
him
and
mocking
him
at
the
door
of
the
bath
while
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
was
sitting
weeping
in
the
midst
of
the
dye-women36
and
tire-women37
she
resembles
more
than
any
other
person
this
youth
they
have
prohibited
her
father
from
going
to
her
and
i
have
never
seen
o
my
sister
a
more
ugly
wretch
than
this
humpback
but
as
to
the
maiden
she
is
more
beautiful
than
this
youth

to
this
story
of
the
efreet
the
jinneeyeh
answered
thou
liest
for
this
youth
is
the
most
beautiful
of
the
people
of
his
age
but
the
efreet
replied
by
allah
o
my
sister
the
maiden
is
more
beautiful
than
he
however
none
but
he
is
suited
to
her
for
they
resemble
each
other
and
probably
are
brother
and
sister
or
cousins
and
how
will
she
be
thrown
away
upon
this
humpback
she
therefore
said
to
him
o
my
brother
let
us
place
ourselves
beneath
him
and
lift
him
up
and
take
him
to
the
maiden
of
whom
thou
speakest
and
see
which
of
the
two
is
more
beautiful
the
efreet
answered
i
hear
and
obey
this
proposal
is
right
and
there
can
be
no
better
determination
than
this
which
thou
hast
chosen
therefore
i
will
carry
him
so
he
lifted
him
up
and
soared
into
the
sky
and
the
jinneeyeh
flew
by
his
side
until
he
descended
with
him
in
the
city
of
cairo
where
he
placed
him
upon
a
maááabah38
and
roused
him
from
his
sleep39

when
therefore
he
awoke
and
found
that
he
was
not
at
his
fathers
tomb
in
the
land
of
el-baárah
he
looked
to
the
right
and
left
and
perceived
that
he
was
in
a
city
that
was
not
el-baárah
and
would
have
cried
out
but
the
efreet
winked
to
him
and
lighting
for
him
a
candle
said
to
him
know
that
i
have
brought
thee
hither
and
i
desire
to
do
thee
a
service
for
the
sake
of
god
take
therefore
this245
candle
and
go
with
it
to
yonder
bath
and
mix
with
the
people
there
and
proceed
with
them
until
thou
arrivest
at
the
saloon
of
the
bride
then
go
before
and
enter
the
saloon
and
fear
no
one
and
when
thou
hast
entered
station
thyself
on
the
right
of
the
humpbacked
bridegroom
and
whenever
the
tire-women
and
singing-women
and
dye-women
come
to
thee
put
thy
hand
into
thy
pocket
thou
wilt
find
it
full
of
gold
and
do
thou
take
it
by
the
handful
and
throw
it
to
them
and
imagine
not
that
thou
wilt
put
thy
hand
in
and
not
find
it
filled
with
gold
give
therefore
to
every
one
who
cometh
to
thee
by
the
handful
and
fear
nothing
but
rely
upon
him
who
created
thee
for
this
will
not
be
through
thine
own
strength
or
power
but
through
the
strength
of
god
and
his
power

the
efreet
attended
by
the
jinneeyeh
carrying
off
bedr-ed-deen
on
hearing
these
words
of
the
efreet
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
said
what
is
this
event
and
what
manner
of
kindness
is
this
and
he
went
with
his
candle
to
the
bath
where
he
found
the
humpback
mounted
on
his
horse
and
he
joined
himself
to
the
party
in
the246
same
garb
in
which
he
had
arrived
and
with
the
same
comely
appearance
being
attired
with
a
áarboosh40
and
turban
and
a
farajeeyeh41
interwoven
with
gold
he
proceeded
with
the
pompous
train
and
every
time
that
the
singing-women
stopped
for
the
people
to
give
them
money
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
found
it
filled
with
gold
and
took
it
by
the
handful
and
threw
it
into
the
tambourine42
for
the
singing-women
and
tire-women
filling
the
tambourine
with
pieces
of
gold
and
the
singing-women
were
amazed
and
the
people
wondered
at
his
beauty
and
loveliness
thus
he
continued
to
do
until
they
arrived
at
the
house
of
the
wezeer
when
the
chamberlains
drove
back
the
people
and
prevented
their
entrance
but
the
singing-women
and
tire-women
said
by
allah
we
will
not
enter
unless
this
youth
enter
with
us
for
he
hath
overwhelmed
us
with
his
favours
and
the
bride
shall
not
be
displayed
unless
he
be
presentâand
upon
this
they
entered
with
him
into
the
saloon
of
the
festivity
and
seated
him
in
spite
of
the
humpbacked
bridegroom
all
the
ladies
of
the
emeers
and
wezeers
and
chamberlains
were
ranged
in
two
rows
each
lady
holding
a
large
lighted
candle
and
having
her
head-veil
drawn
across
the
lower
part
of
her
face
thus
they
stood
in
two
rows
to
the
right
and
the
left
from
the
foot
of
the
couch
of
the
bride
to
the
upper
end
of
the
leewÃn
that
adjoined
the
chamber
from
which
the
bride
was
to
come
forth
and
when
the
ladies
beheld
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
his
beauty
and
loveliness
his
face
shining
like
the
crescent
of
the
moon
the
hearts
of
all
of
them
inclined
to
him
and
the
female
singers
said
to
all
the
women
who
were
present
know
that
this
charming
youth
hath
given
us
nothing
but
red
gold
therefore
fail
not
to
serve
him
properly
and
obey
him
in
whatever
he
shall
say
the
women
crowded
round
him
to
gaze
at
his
charms
and
their
minds
were
overpowered
by
astonishment
at
his
beauty
and
each
of
them
wished
that
she
might
be
in
his
bosom
for
a
year
or
a
month
or
an
hour
they
removed
the
veils
from
their
faces
and
their
hearts
were
perplexed
and
they
said
joy
to
the
person
to
whom
this
youth
belongeth
or
to
the
person
over
whom
he
is
lord
then
they
imprecated
evil
upon
the
humpbacked
groom
and
him
who
was
the
cause
of
his
marriage
to
that
lovely
maiden
and
every
time
that
they
prayed
for
blessings
upon
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
they
imprecated
misfortunes
upon
the
humpback

the
singing-women
then
beat
the
tambourines
and
the
tire-women
approached
with
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
in
the
midst
of
them
they
had
perfumed
her
with
sweet
scents
and
essences
and
clad
her
and
adorned
her
hair
and
neck
with
various
ornaments247
decking
her
with
garments
such
as
were
worn
by
the
ancient
monarchs
of
persia
among
these
was
a
loose
gown
embroidered
with
red
gold
presenting
the
forms
of
wild
beasts
and
birds
hanging
down
over
her
other
clothes
and
round
her
neck
was
a
necklace
worth
thousands
composed
of
jewels
such
as
neither
a
king
of
el-yemen
nor

she
was
like
the
moon
shining
in
its
fourteenth
night
and
when
she
approached
she
resembled
a
áooreeyeh43
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
created
her
so
splendid
a
being
the
women
encompassed
her
and
appeared
like
stars
she
in
the
midst
of
them
being
as
the
moon
when
the
clouds
have
withdrawn
from
before
it
meanwhile
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
remained
sitting
with
the
company
gazing
at
him
and
as
the
bride
approached
with
a
dignified
and
graceful
gait
the
humpbacked
groom
rose
to
her
to
kiss
her
but
she
turned
aside
from
him
and
went
and
stood
before
áasan
the
son
of
her
uncle
the
company
laughed
at
this
and
when
they
beheld
her
turn
towards
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
saw
him
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
take
out
handfuls
of
gold
and
throw
it
into
the
tambourine
of
the
singing-women
they
were
delighted
and
said
we
wish
that
this
bride
were
thineâand
he
smiled
all
this
time
the
humpbacked
groom
was
alone
looking
like
an
ape
and
every
time
that
they
lighted
his
candle
it
went
out
again
and
he
was
confounded
and
remained
sitting
in
the
dark
full
of
secret
indignation
with
all
the
company
surrounding
him
while
the
lighted
candles
presented
an
appearance
of
beauty
that
was
most
admirable
so
that
every
person
of
reflection
was
amazed
at
their
splendour
but
as
to
the
bride
she
raised
her
hands
towards
heaven
and
said
o
allah
make
this
to
be
my
husband
and
relieve
me
from
this
humpbacked
groomâthe
tire-women
then
proceeded
to
display
the
bride
in
different
dresses
to
the
seventh
suit
before
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
of
el-baárah
the
humpbacked
groom
remaining
alone
and
when
they
had
finished
this
ceremony
they
gave
permission
to
the
company
to
depart
so
all
who
were
present
at
the
festivity
both
women
and
children
went
out
except
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
the
humpbacked
groom
after
which
the
tire-women
conducted
the
bride
to
an
inner
chamber
to
take
off
her
ornaments
and
outer
robes
and
to
prepare
her
for
the
bridegrooms
visit

upon
this
the
humpbacked
groom
approached
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
thou
hast
made
us
happy
by
thy
company
this
night
and
overwhelmed
us
with
thy
favours
but
now
wherefore
dost
thou
not
rise
and
go
to
thy
house
without
thy
being248
ejected
he
answered
in
the
name
of
allahâand
rose
and
went
out
from
the
door
but
the
efreet
met
him
and
said
unto
him
stay
o
bedr-ed-deen
and
when
the
humpback
retires
into
the
private
closet
enter
thou
and
seat
thyself
in
the
bride-chamber
and
when
the
bride
cometh
say
to
her
i
am
thy
husband
and
the
king
had
not
recourse
to
this
stratagem
from
any
other
motive
than
his
fearing
for
thee
the
effect
of
the
eye44
and
this
whom
thou
hast
seen
is
one
of
our
groomsâthen
approach
her
and
uncover
her
face
and
fear
no
evil
from
any
one

while
bedr-ed-deen
was
thus
conversing
with
the
efreet
lo
the
groom
entered
the
closet
and
seated
himself
and
immediately
the
efreet
rose
before
him
from
the
trough
of
water
that
was
in
the
closet45
in
the
form
of
a
mouse
and

transformations
transformations
cried
zeekâwhat
brought
thee
here
said
the
humpback
the
mouse
then
increased
in
size
and
became
like
a
cat
and
then
increased
and
became
a
dog
and
cried
owh
owh
at
the
sight
of
this
the
groom
was
terrified
and
exclaimed
get
away
thou
unlucky46
the
dog
however
still
increased
and
swelled
until
it
became
an
ass
and
brayed
in
his
face
crying
hÃá
hÃáâupon
which
the
groom
in
terror
cried
out
come
to
my
aid
o
people
of
the
house
but
lo
the
ass
increased
and
became
like
a
buffalo
and
stopping
up
the
place
before
him
spoke
with
the
speech
of
a
son
of
adam
and
said
wo
be
to
thee
o
humpback
o
filthiest
of
grooms
upon
this
the
groom
was
seized
with
a
colick
and
seated
himself
upon
the
slabs
and
his
teeth
knocked
together
the
efreet
then
said
to
him
hath
the
earth
become
narrow
to
thee
that
thou
wouldst
marry
none
but
my
mistress
but
the

transformations
groom
was
silent249
return
me
an
answer
said
the
efreet
or
i
will
make
thine
abode
to
be
in
the
dustâby
allah
then
answered
the
groom
i
am
not
in
fault
for
they
compelled
me
and
i
knew
not
that
she
had
a
lover
among
the
buffaloes
but
now
i
repent
before
allah
and
before
thee
then
the
efreet
said
i
swear
by
allah
that
if
thou
depart
now
from
this
place
or
utter
a

bedr-ed-deen
and
his
bride
word
before
the
sun
hath
risen
i
will
slay
thee
and
when
the
sun
hath
risen
go
thy
way
and
never
return
to
this
house
and
he
seized
the
humpbacked
groom
and
placing
his
head
upside
down
upon
the
slabs
and
his
feet
upwards
said
to
him
remain
here
and
i
will
watch
thee
until
sunriseâthus
did
it
happen
to
the
humpback

now
as
to
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
of
el-baárah
he
left
the
humpback
and
the
efreet
contending
together
and
entering
the
house
seated
himself
in
the
bride-chamber
and
lo
the
bride
approached
accompanied
by
an
old
woman
who
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
said
o
aboo-shihÃb47
rise
and
take
thy
bride
and
i
commend
thee
to
the
care
of
allah
then
the
old
woman
went
away
and
the
bride
whose
name
was
sitt-el-áosn48
advanced
to
the
upper
end
of
the
chamber
her
heart
was
broken
and
she
said
within
herself
by
allah
i
will
not
suffer
him
to
caress
me
though
my
spirit
depart
from
me
but
when
she
had
proceeded
to
the
upper
end
of
the
chamber
she
beheld
bedr-ed-deen
and
said
my
beloved
until
this
hour
art
thou
remaining
i
had
said
within
myself
perhaps
thou
and
the
humpbacked
groom
are
to
share
me
between
youâwhat
said
he
should
give250
the
groom
access
to
thee
and
wherefore
should
he
be
my
partner
in
the
possession
of
theeâwho
then
she
asked
is
my
husband
thou
or
heâo
my
mistress
answered
bedr-ed-deen
we
did
not
this
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
make
a
jest
of
him
and
that
we
might
laugh
at
him
for
when
the
tire-women
and
the
singing-women
and
thy
family
beheld
thine
admirable
beauty
they
feared
for
us
the
effect
of
the
eye
and
thy
father
hired
him
for
ten
pieces
of
gold
in
order
that
he
might
divert
from
us
the
eye
and
now
he
hath
departed
when
sitt-el-áosn
heard
these
words
of
bedr-ed-deen
she
smiled
and
uttered
a
gentle
laugh
and
said
by
allah
thou
hast
extinguished
my
fire
take
me
then
i
conjure
thee
and
press
me
to
thy
bosomâand
they
embraced
each
other

not
long
after
this
the
efreet
said
to
the
jinneeyeh
arise
and
place
thyself
beneath
the
youth
and
let
us
convey
him
back
lest
the
morning
overtake
us
for
the
time
is
near
so
she
advanced
towards
him
and
placing
herself
beneath
his
skirt
as
he
lay
asleep
took
him
up
and
flew
away
with
him
in
the
state
in
which
she
found
him
clad
only
in
his
shirt
and
pursued
her
flight
with
the
efreet
by
her
side
but
god
gave
permission
to
some
angels
to
cast
at
the
efreet
a
shooting-star
of
fire
and
he
was
burnt
the
jinneeyeh
however
escaped
unhurt
and
deposited
bedr-ed-deen
in
the
place
over
which
the
shooting-star
had
burnt
the
efreet
she
would
not
pass
beyond
it
fearing
for
his
safety
and
as
destiny
had
appointed
this
place
was
damascus
so
she
placed
him
by
one
of
the
gates
of
this
city
and
flew
away

gate
of
damascus
when
daylight
therefore
came
and
the
gates
were
opened
the
people
coming
forth
beheld
a
beautiful
youth
clad
in
his
shirt
and
with
a
cotton
skull-cap
without
a
turban
in
consequence
of
his
having
been
so
long
wakeful
he
was
now
immersed
in
sleep
and
when
the
people
saw
him
some
said
would
that
he
had
waited
till
he
had
put
on
his
clothesâanother
said
objects
of
pity
are
the
children
of
men
of
condition
probably
this
youth
hath
just
come
forth
from
his
drinking-place
on
account
of
some
business
and
intoxication
hath
overcome
him
and
he
hath
wandered
from
the
place
to
which
he
would
go
until
he
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
city
and
finding
it
locked
hath
slept
hereâthey
had
expressed
various
opinions
respecting
him
and
were
wondering
at
his
case
when
bedr-ed-deen
awoke
perceiving
that
he
was
at
the
gate
of
a
city
and
surrounded
by
men
he
was
astonished
and
said
where
am
i
o
good
people
and
what
is
the
cause
of
your
assembling
around
me
and
what
hath
befallen
me251
among
you
they
answered
we
saw
thee
at
the
call
to
morning-prayer
lying
at
this
gate
asleep
and
we
know
nothing
more
of
thy
case
where
wast
thou
sleeping
this
last
nightâby
allah
o
people
he
replied
i
was
sleeping
this
last
night
in
cairoâon
hearing
this
one
of
them
said
dost
thou
eat
áasheesh49
another
said
thou
art
mad
how
couldst
thou
be
passing
the
night
in
cairo
and
be
sleeping
in
the
morning
at
the
city
of
damascusâhe
said
to
them
by
allah
o
good
people
i
will
tell
you
no
falsehood
i
was
last
night
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
day
before
i
was
at
el-baárah
one
of
them
said
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
another
said
this
youth
is
mad
and
they
clapped
their
hands
at
him
and
conversing
together
said
alas
for
his
youth
by
allah
there
is
no
denying
his
madnessâthey
then
said
to
him
return
to
thy
reason
but
he
replied
i
was
yesterday
a
bridegroom
in
the
land
of
egyptâprobably
thou
hast
dreamt
said
they
and
hast
seen
this
of
which
thou
speakest252
in
thy
sleep
and
áasan
was
confounded
and
said
by
allah
this
was
not
a
dream
and
where
is
the
humpbacked
groom
who
was
sitting
with
us
and
the
purse
of
gold
that
i
had
and
where
are
my
clothes
and
my
drawersâhe
then
rose
and
entered
the
city
and
proceeded
through
its
great
thoroughfare-streets
and
market-streets
and
the
people
crowded
round
him
and
paraded
him
so
he
entered
the
shop
of
a
cook
now
this
cook
was
a
robber50
whom
god
had
caused
to
repent
of
his
unlawful
actions
and
he
had
opened
a
cooks
shop
and
all
the
people
of
damascus
feared
him
on
account
of
his
boldness
therefore
when
they
saw
that
the
youth
had
entered
this
shop
they
left
him
being
afraid

when
the
cook
beheld
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
observed
his
beauty
and
comeliness
love
for
him
entered
his
heart
and
he
said
to
him
whence
art
thou
o
young
man
relate
to
me
thy
story
for
thou
art
become
dearer
to
me
than
my
soulâso
he
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
from
beginning
to
end
and
the
cook
said
to
him
o
my
master
bedr-ed-deen
know
that
this
is
a
wonderful
event
and
an
extraordinary
story
but
o
my
son
conceal
thy
case
until
god
dispel
thy
trouble
and
remain
with
me
in
this
place
and
as
i
have
not
a
son
i
will
adopt
thee
as
such
bedr-ed-deen
replied
let
it
be
as
thou
desirest
o
uncle
and
immediately
the
cook
went
out
to
the
mart
and
bought
for
bedr-ed-deen
costly
clothes
and
put
them
on
him
he
then
went
to
the
áÃáee
and
made
a
declaration
that
he
was
his
adopted
son51
so
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
became
known
throughout
the
city
of
damascus
as
the
son
of
the
cook
and
he
sat
with
him
in
the
shop
to
receive
the
money
and
in
this
situation
he
remained

now
as
to
sitt-el-áosn
when
daybreak
came
and
she
awoke
she
found
not
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
remaining
with
her
and
imagining
that
he
would
soon
return
she
sat
a
while
expecting
him
and
lo
her
father
came
in
to
her
troubled
at
that
which
had
befallen
him
from
the
suláÃn
and
at
his
having
married
his
daughter
by
force
to
one
of
his
servants
the
humpbacked
groom
and
he
said
within
himself
i
will
kill
this
girl
if
she
have
suffered
the
wretch
to
caress
her
so
he
advanced
to
the
bride-chamber
and
stopping
at
the
door
said
o
sitt-el-áosn
she
answered
well
o
my
masterâand
came
forth
to
him
walking
with
a
vacillating
gait
through
joy
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
her
countenance
beamed
with
increased
splendour
in
consequence
of
her
union
with
that
gazelle
when
her
father
therefore
saw
her
in
this
state
he
exclaimed
to
her
o
thou
base
creature
art
thou
delighted
with
this
groom
on
hearing
these253
words
of
her
father
sitt-el-áosn
smiled
and
replied
by
allah
it
is
enough
that
thou
hast
done
and
that
the
people
laugh
at
me
and
put
me
on
an
equality
with
this
groom
who
is
not
in
my
estimation
of
the
value
of
a
paring
of
one
of
my
finger-nails
but
as
to
my
husbandâby
allah
i
never
in
the
course
of
my
life
passed
a
night
more
delightful
than
that
which
i
have
just
passed
in
his
company
therefore
jest
not
with
me
by
mentioning
that
humpbackâwhen
her
father
heard
what
she
said
he
was
filled
with
rage
his
eyes
glared
so
that
little
appeared
of
them
but
the
white
and
he
said
to
her
wo
to
thee
what
are
these
words
that
thou
sayest
verily
the
humpbacked
groom
hath
passed
the
night
with
theeâi
conjure
thee
by
allah
she
rejoined
that
thou
mention
him
not
may
allah
reject
him
and
reject
his
father
continue
not
then
to
mock
me
by
mentioning
him
for
the
groom
was
only
hired
for
ten
pieces
of
gold
and
he
took
his
hire
and
departed
and
i
came
and
entered
the
bride-chamber
and
beheld
my
husband
seated
after
the
singing-women
had
displayed
me
before
him
and
he
threw
them
red
gold
until
he
had
enriched
the
poor
who
were
present
i
have
reclined
upon
the
bosom
of
my
gentle-hearted
husband
with
the
black
eyes
and
the
joined
eyebrowsâwhen
her
father
heard
this
the
light
became
darkness
before
his
face
and
he
exclaimed
to
her
o
thou
abandoned
one
what
is
this
that
thou
sayest
where
is
thy
reasonâo
my
father
she
replied
thou
hast
broken
my
heart
in
pieces
wherefore
dost
thou
pay
no
attention
this
of
whom
i
spake
is
my
husband
and
he
hath
retired
to
his
private
closet

so
her
father
went
thither
in
a
state
of
astonishment
and
entering
the
closet
found
the
humpbacked
groom
with
his
head
upon
the
slabs
and
his
feet
turned
upwards
and
the
wezeer
was
confounded
at
the
sight
and
said
is
not
this
the
humpbackâand
he
spoke
to
him
but
the
humpback
returned
no
answer
thinking
that
it
was
the
efreet
who
addressed
him
the
wezeer
therefore
cried
out
at
him
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
to
him
speak
or
i
will
cut
off
thy
head
with
this
sword
upon
which
the
humpback
exclaimed
by
allah
o
sheykh
of
the
efreets
from
the
time
that
thou
placedst
me
here
i
have
not
raised
my
head
i
conjure
thee
therefore
that
thou
shew
favour
to
meâthe
wezeer
on
hearing
the
humpback
thus
address
him
said
to
him
what
sayest
thou
i
am
the
father
of
the
bride
and
i
am
not
an
efreetâthen
said
the
humpback
my
life
is
not
in
thy
hand
nor
art
thou
able
to

way
before

to
thee
who
hath
treated
me
in
this
manner
ye
would
not
marry
me254
to
any
but
the
mistress
of
buffaloes
and
the
mistress
of
efreets
may
allah
then
confound
him
who
married
me
to
her
and
confound
him
who
was
the
cause
of
itâthen
did
the
humpbacked
groom
address
the
wezeer
the
father
of
the
bride
again
saying
allah
confound
him
who
was
the
cause
of
thisârise
said
the
wezeer
and
depart
from
this
placeâam
i
mad
he
replied
that
i
should
go
with
thee
without
the
permission
of
the
efreet
for
he
said
to
me
when
the
sun
shall
have
risen
go
thy
wayâhath
the
sun
then
risen
or
not
for
i
cannot
depart
from
my
place
until
the
sun
hath
risenâupon
this
the
wezeer
said
to
him
who
brought
thee
to
this
place
he
answered
i
came
hither
yesterday
and
a
dust
rose
from
the
midst
of
the
water
and
cried
out
and
increased
in
bulk
until
it
became
of
the
size
of
a
buffalo
and
said
to
me
words
that
entered
my
ear
leave
me
therefore
and
go
allah
confound
the
bride
and
him
who
married
me
to
herâthe
wezeer
then
approached
him
and
dragged
him
forth
and
he
went
out
running
doubting
whether
the
sun
had
risen
and
went
up
to
the
suláÃn
and
informed
him
of
that
which
had
happened
to
him
with
the
efreet

but
as
to
the
wezeer
the
father
of
the
bride
he
returned
with
his
reason
perplexed
respecting
the
case
of
his
daughter
and
said
to
her
o
my
daughter
reveal
to
me
thy
story
she
replied
the
elegant
person
before
whom
i
was
displayed
remained
with
me
and
if
thou
believe
me
not
see
this
is
his
turban
twisted
just
as
it
was
upon
the
chair52
and
his
drawers
are
under
the
bed
and
in
them
is
something
wrapped
up
i
know
not
what
it
is
so
when
her
father
heard
this
he
entered
the
bride-chamber
and
found
the
turban
of
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
the
son
of
his
brother
and
taking
it
up
he
turned
it
over
and
said
this
is
such
a
turban
as
is
worn
by
wezeers
except
that
it
is
of
the
mÃáilee53
kind
he
then
observed
an
amulet
sewed
in
his
red
cloth
cap
and
he
unsewed
it
and
he
took
the
drawers
and
found
the
purse
containing
the
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
opening
this
he
discovered
in
it
a
paper
which
when
he
had
read
it
he
saw
to
be
a
copy
of
the
jews
contract
with
the
name
of
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
the
son
of
noor-ed-deen
of
cairo
and
he
found
also
the
thousand
pieces
of
gold
but
when
he
read
the
paper
he
cried
aloud
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
as
soon
as
he
recovered
and
understood
the
case
he
was
astonished
and
exclaimed
there
is
no
deity
but
god
who
is
able
to
do
whatsoever
he
willeth
then
said
he
o
my
daughter
knowest
thou
who
hath
become
thy
husband
she
answered
noâhe
is
the
son
of
my
brother
said
he
and
the
son
of255
thine
uncle
and
these
thousand
pieces
of
gold
are
thy
dowry
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
god
would
that
i
knew
how
this
event
hath
happenedâthen
he
opened
the
amulet
that
was
sewed
up
and
found
in
it
a
paper
written
by
the
hand
of
his
brother
noor-ed-deen
of
cairo
the
father
of
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
when
he
beheld
the
hand-writing
of
his
brother
he
repeated
this
coupletâ

i
behold
their
footsteps
and
melt
with
desire
and
pour
forth
my
tears
upon
the
places
they
have
trodden
begging
of
him
who
hath
afflicted
me
by
their
separation
that
he
will
bless
me
some
day
by
a
reunion
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen
recovering
from
a
swoon
so
saying
he
read
the
paper
and
found
in
it
the
date
of
his
marriage
to
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
of
el-baárah
and
that
of
his
first
introduction
to
her
and
a
record
of
his
age
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
the
date
of
the
birth
of
his
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
he
wondered
and
shook
with
delight
and
comparing
what
had
happened
to
his
brother
with
the
events
that
had
happened
to
himself
he
found
that
they
corresponded
exactly
his
marriage
and
the
marriage
of
his
brother
agreed
in
date
and
their
first
visits
to
their
respective
wives
in
like
manner
as
also
the
birth
of
bedr-ed-deen
the
son
of
his
brother
and
the
birth
of
his
daughter
sitt-el-áosn
he
took
the
two
papers
and
going
up
with
them
to
the
suláÃn
he
acquainted
him
with
all
that
had
happened
from
the
first
of
the
case
to
the
last
and
the
king
was
astonished
and
ordered
that
the
case
should
be
immediately
recorded
the
wezeer
then
remained
in
expectation
of
the
son
of
his
brother
but
he
met
with
no
tidings
of
him
so
he
said
by
allah
i256
will
do
a
deed
that
none
hath
done
before
meâand
he
took
an
ink-case
and
a
pen
and
wrote
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
of
the
house
describing
the
money-chest
as
having
been
in
such
a
place
and
a
certain
curtain
in
such
another
place
and
everything
in
the
house
in
like
manner
and
he
folded
up
the
paper
and
ordered
that
all
the
furniture
should
be
stored
up
and
he
took
the
turban
with
its
áarboosh
and
also
the
farajeeyeh
and
the
purse
and
kept
them
himself

after
this
in
due
time
the
daughter
of
the
wezeer
gave
birth
to
a
son
like
the
moon
resembling
his
father
in
beauty
and
symmetry
and
splendour
and
loveliness
they
received
him
from
his
mother
and
blackened
the
edges
of
his
eyes
with
koál54
and
delivered
him
to
the
nurses
and
named
him
ajeeb55
his
day
was
as
a
month
and
his
month
as
a
year56
and
when
seven
years
had
passed
over
him
his
grandfather
committed
him
to
a
schoolmaster
whom
he
charged
to
educate
him
with
great
care
he
continued
at
the
school
four
years
and
used
to
fight
with
his
schoolfellows
and
abuse
them
saying
to
them
who
among
you
is
like
me
i
am
the
son
of
the
wezeer
of
cairoâso
the
boys
went
together
to
complain
to
the
monitor
of
that
which
they
suffered
from
ajeeb
and
the
monitor
said
to
them
i
will
teach
you
something
to
say
to
him
when
he
cometh
and
he
shall
repent
of
his
coming
to
the
school
and
it
is
this
to-morrow
when
he
is
come
seat
yourselves
around
him
and
say
to
one
another
by
allah
none
shall
play
with
us
at
this
game
excepting
him
who
shall
tell
us
the
name
of
his
mother
and
that
of
his
father
and
he
who
knoweth
not
the
name
of
his
mother
and
that
of
his
father
is
illegitimate
therefore
he
shall
not
play
with
us
accordingly
on
the
following
morning
they
came
to
the
school
and
ajeeb
was
there
and
the
boys
surrounded
him
and
said
as
the
monitor
had
directed
them
and
they
all
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
one
said
my
name
is
mÃjid
and
my
mother
is
alawee
and
my
father
is
ezz-ed-deenâthen
another
said
after
the
same
manner
and
another
and
so
on
until
the
turn
came
to
ajeeb
and
he
said
to
them
my
name
is
ajeeb
and
my
mother
is
sitt-el-áosn
and
my
father
is
shems-ed-deen
the
wezeer
of
cairoâand
they
said
to
him
by
allah
the
wezeer
is
not
thy
father
ajeeb
replied
the
wezeer
is
my
father
indeedâand
upon
this
the
boys
laughed
at
him
and
clapped
their
hands
at
him
saying
thou
knowest
not
who
is
thy
father
get
away
from
us
therefore
for
none
shall
play
with
us
excepting
him
who
knoweth
the
name
of
his
fatherâand
immediately
the
boys
dispersed
from
around257
him
and
made
a
jest
of
him
in
consequence
of
this
treatment
his
heart
became
contracted
and
he
was
almost
choked
with
crying
and
the
monitor
said
to
him
dost
thou
really
consider
as
thy
father
him
who
is
thy
grandfather
the
wezeer
the
father
of
thy
mother
sitt-el-áosn
thy
father
thou
knowest
not
nor
do
we
know
him
for
the
suláÃn
married
her
to
the
humpbacked
groom
and
the
jinn
came
and
prevented
him
so
if
thou
know
not
thy
father
they
will
regard
thee
among
them
as
illegitimate
dost
thou
not
see
that
the
son
of
the
woman
who
is
coveted
as
a
wife
knoweth
his
father
the
wezeer
of
cairo
is
thy
grandfather
and
as
to
thy
father
we
know
him
not
nor
dost
thou
return
therefore
to
thy
reason

the
school
upon
this
ajeeb
went
immediately
to
his
mother
sitt-el-áosn
and
complained
to
her
and
wept
and
his
weeping
prevented
his
speaking
and
when
his
mother
heard
his
complaint
and
his
crying
her
heart
was
inflamed
for
him
and
she
said
to
him
o
my
son
what
maketh
thee
weep
tell
me
thy
storyâso
he
told
her
what
he
had
heard
from
the
boys
and
from
the
monitor
and
said
to
her
o
my
mother
who
is
my
father
she
answered
him
thy
father
is
the
wezeer
of
cairo
but
he
said
he
is
not
my
father
tell
me
not
therefore
what
is
false
for
the
wezeer
is
thy
father
not
mine
who
then
is
my
father
if
thou
do
not
tell
me
truly
i
will
kill
myself
with
this
daggerâand
when
his
mother
heard
the
mention
of
his
father
she
wept
at
the
allusion
to
the
son
of
her
uncle
and
remembering
the
amiable
qualities
of
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
of
el-baárah
and258
what
had
happened
to
herself
and
him
she
recited
an
ode
commencing
thusâ

they
excited
love
in
my
heart
and
departed
and
far
distant
hath
their
abode
become
reason
forsook
me
when
they
withdrew
and
sleep
and
patience
abandoned
me
and
she
wept
and
cried
out
and
her
son
did
the
same
and
lo
the
wezeer
entered
his
heart
burned
within
him
when
he
beheld
their
state
and
he
said
to
them
what
causeth
you
to
weep
she
acquainted
him
therefore
with
the
treatment
that
her
son
had
experienced
from
the
other
boys
of
the
school
and
he
also
wept
and
called
to
mind
what
had
happened
to
his
brother
and
himself
and
his
daughter
and
he
knew
not
the
mystery
of
the
case
then
suddenly
he
arose
and
going
up
to
the
council-chamber
presented
himself
before
the
king
and
related
to
him
the
story
begging
his
permission
to
travel
eastwards
to
the
city
of
el-baárah
that
he
might
make
inquiries
respecting
the
son
of
his
brother
and
requesting
also
of
the
suláÃn
that
he
would
write
letters
for
him
to
all
the
countries
through
which
he
might
pass
that
if
he
found
the
son
of
his
brother
in
any
place
he
might
take
him
away
and
he
wept
before
the
suláÃn
and
the
heart
of
the
king
was
moved
with
compassion
for
him
and
he
wrote
for
him
letters
to
all
the
regions
and
countries
upon
which
the
wezeer
rejoiced
and
having
offered
up
a
prayer
for
the
suláÃn
took
leave
of
him

he
descended
immediately
and
prepared
for
the
journey
and
taking
with
him
all
that
he
required
together
with
his
daughter
and
her
son
ajeeb
travelled
the
first
day
and
the
second
and
the
third
and
proceeded
until
he
arrived
at
the
city
of
damascus
and
beheld
it
with
its
trees
and
streams
celebrated
by
the
poets
he
alighted
in
the
open
space
called
meydÃn
el-áaábÃ

and
when
he
had
pitched
his
tents
said
to
his
servants
we
will
take
rest
here
two
days
so
the
servants
entered
the
city
to
gratify
their
various
desires
one
to
sell
another
to
buy
a
third
to
enter
the
bath
and
a
fourth
to
visit
the
mosque
of
the
benee-umeiyeh
which
hath
not
in
the
world
its
equal
ajeeb
also
entered
the
city
accompanied
by
his
eunuch
in
order
to
amuse
themselves
and
the
eunuch
walked
behind
ajeeb
having
in
his
hand
a
whip
that
would
strike
down
a
camel
and
when
the
people
of
damascus
beheld
ajeeb
and
his
elegance
of
form
and
perfect
beauty
and
observed
him
to
be
endowed
with
admirable
loveliness
and
with
kindness
of
manner
more
bland
than
the
northern259
zephyr
sweeter
than
limpid
water
to
the
thirsty
and
more
pleasant
than
health
to
the
diseased
they
followed
him
running
after
him
in
crowds
and
some
sat
waiting
in
the
streets
to
see
him
pass
thus
did
they
until
the
slave
as
destiny
had
ordained
stopped
before
the
shop
of
ajeebs
father
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
in
which
the
cook
who
had
acknowledged
him
as
his
adopted
son
in
the
presence
of
the
áÃáees
and
witnesses
had
established
him
and
this
cook
had
died
and
left
him
all
his
property
together
with
his
shop57

when
the
slave
stopped
there
on
this
day
the
servants
also
stopped
with
him
and
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
beheld
his
son
and
was
charmed
with
him
observing
his
extreme
beauty
his
soul
yearned
towards
him
with
natural
sympathy
and
his
heart
clung
to
him
he
had
just
prepared
a
conserve
of
pomegranate-grains
sweetened
with
sugar
and
the
affection
divinely
inspired
increased
in
him
so
he
called
out
in
ecstasy
and
said
o
my
master
o
thou
who
hast
captivated
my
heart
and
soul
and
to
whom
my
affections
are
drawn
by
sympathy
wilt
thou
come
in
to
me
and
refresh
my
heart
and
eat
of
my
food
and
when
he
had
said
this
his
eyes
overflowed
with
involuntary
tears
and
he
reflected
upon
his
past
experience
and
his
condition
at
the
present
time
when
ajeeb
heard
the
address
of
his
father
his
heart
was
in
like
manner
drawn
towards
him
by
sympathy
and
he
looked
towards
the
eunuch
and
said
to
him
verily
my
heart
is
moved
with
sympathy
for
this
cook
he
seemeth
to
have
parted
with
a
son
come
in
with
us
therefore
that
we
may
refresh
his
heart
and
eat
his
offering
of
hospitality
perhaps
god
through
our
so
doing
may
accomplish
our
union
with
our
father
but
the
eunuch
replied
by
allah
o
my
master
it
is
not
proper
how
should
we
who
are
of
the
family
of
the
wezeer
eat
in
the
shop
of
a
cook
i
will
however
drive
away
the
people
from
thee
lest
they
see
thee
otherwise
it
will
be
impossible
for
thee
to
enter
the
shop
on
hearing
the
reply
of
the
eunuch
bedr-ed-deen
was
surprised
and
looking
towards
him
while
his
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
said
to
him
verily
my
heart
loveth
himâlet
us
hear
no
more
of
these
words
said
the
eunuchâand
he
desired
the
youth
not
to
enter
but
the
father
of
ajeeb
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
eunuch
and
said
great
sir
wherefore
wilt
thou
not
refresh
my
heart
and
come
in
to
me
o
thou
who
resemblest
black
dust
but
whose
heart
is
white
o
thou
who
hast
been
described
in
such
and
such
terms
of
praiseâso
that
the
eunuch
laughed
and
said
what
wouldst
thou
say
speak
and
be
briefâand
bedr-ed-deen
recited
this
couplet260â

were
it
not
for
his
accomplishments
and
admirable
faithfulness
he
had
not
been
invested
with
authority
in
the
abode
of
kings
what
an
excellent
guardian
for
the
áareem
is
he
on
account
of
his
beauty
the
angels
of
heaven
wait
upon
him
this
address
pleased
the
eunuch
so
much
that
he
took
the
hand
of
ajeeb
and
entered
the
cooks
shop
and
bedr-ed-deen
ladled
out
a
saucerful
of

my

they
all
ate
together
until
they
were
satisfied
after
which
the
youth
and
the
slave
arose
and
quitted
the
shop
of
bedr-ed-deen
who
felt
as
if
his
soul
had
departed
from
his
body
and
gone
with
them
he
could
not
endure
their
absence
for
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
so
he
shut
up
his
shop
and
followed
them
though
ignorant
that
the
youth
was
his
son
and
walked
quickly
until
he
came
up
to
them
before
they
had
gone
out
from
the
great
gate
whereupon
the
eunuch
looking
back
at
him
said
what
dost
thou
want
o
cook
bedr-ed-deen
answered
when
ye
departed
from
me
i
felt
as
if
my
soul
had
quitted
my
body
and
having
some
business
in
the
suburb
i
was
desirous
of
accompanying
you
to
transact
my
business
and
after
that
to
return
but
the
eunuch
was
angry
and
said
to
ajeeb
verily
this
repast
was
unlucky
respectful
treatment
hath
become
incumbent
on
us
and
see
he
is
following
us
from
place
to
place
ajeeb
therefore
looked
round
and
seeing
the
cook
was
enraged
and
his
face
became
red
but
he
said
to
the
eunuch
suffer
him
to
walk
in
the
public
road
of
the
muslims
but
when
we
shall
have
turned
from
it
to
our
tents
if
he
do
the
same
and
we
know
that
he
is
following
us
we
will
drive
him
back
and
he
hung
down
his
head
and
went
on
with
the
eunuch
behind
him
bedr-ed-deen
however
followed
them
to
the
meydÃn
el-áaábÃ

and
when
they
had
drawn
near
to
the
tents
they
looked
back
and
saw
him
behind
them
and
ajeeb
was
angry
fearing
that
the
eunuch
might
inform
his
grandfather
and
lest
it
should
be
said
that
he
had
entered
the
cooks
shop
and
that
the
cook
had
followed
him
he
looked
at
him
till
his
eyes
met
the
eye
of
his
father
who
had
become
as
a
body
without
a
soul
and
he
fancied
that
his
eye
bore
an
expression
of
deceit
and
that
he
was
perhaps
a
knave
so
his
anger
increased
and
he
took
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
his
father
and
the
stone
struck
him
on
the
forehead
and
wounded
him
and
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
blood
flowing
over
his
face
ajeeb
went
on
with
the
eunuch
to
the
tents
and
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
when
he
recovered
his
senses
wiped
off
the
blood
and
having
cut
off
a
piece
of
linen
from
his
turban
bound
up
his
head
with
it
blaming
himself
and
saying
i
wronged
the
youth
when
i
shut
up
my
shop
and
followed
him
so
he
thought
i
was
a
deceiver
he
then
returned
to
his
shop
and
occupied
himself
with
the
sale
of
his
meats
and
he
yearned
with
desire
for
his
mother
who
was
at
el-baárah

the
wezeer
his
uncle
remained
at
damascus
three
days
and
then
departed
to
áemá
and
having
entered
this
town
proceeded
thence
inquiring
at
every
place
where
he
halted
in
his
journey
until
he
had262
arrived
at
mÃrideen
and
el-mÃsil
and
diyÃr
bekr
he
continued
his
journey
until
he
arrived
at
the
city
of
el-baárah
and
when
he
had
entered
it
and
taken
up
his
quarters
he
went
and
presented
himself
before
the
suláÃn
who
received
him
with
respect
and
honour
and
inquired
the
reason
of
his
coming
so
he
acquainted
him
with
his
story
and
informed
him
that
the
wezeer
alee
noor-ed-deen
was
his
brother
the
suláÃn
ejaculated
god
have
mercy
upon
him58âand
said
o
áÃáeb59
he
was
my
wezeer
and
i
loved
him
much
he
died
twelve
years60
ago
and
left
a
son
but
we
have
lost
him
and
have
heard
no
tidings
of
him
his
mother
however
is
with
us
for
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
old
wezeer
on
hearing
from
the
king
that
the
mother
of
his
nephew
was
alive
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen
rejoiced
and
said
i
am
desirous
of
having
an
interview
with
her
and
the
king
gave
him
immediate
permission
to
visit
her
at
his
brothers
house
so
he
went
thither
and
kissed
the
threshold
and
entering
an
open
court
found
a
door
over-arched
with
hard
stone
inlaid
with
various
kinds
of
marble
of
every
colour
and
he
walked
along
by
the
walls
of
the
house
and
as
he
cast
his
eyes
around
upon
them
he
observed
the
name
of
his
brother
noor-ed-deen
inscribed
on
them
in
characters
of
gold
and
he
went
to
the
name
and
kissed
it
and
wept
he
then
advanced
to
the
saloon
of
his
brothers
wife
the
mother
of
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
of
el-baárah
during
the
absence
of
her
son
she
had
given
herself
up
to
weeping
and
wailing
night
and
day
and
after
she
had
long
suffered
from
his
separation
she
made
for
her
son
a
tomb
of
marble
in
the
midst
of
the
saloon
where
she
wept
for
him
night
and
day
sleeping
nowhere
but
by
this
tomb
and
when
shems-ed-deen
arrived
at
her
apartment
he
heard
her
voice
apostrophizing
the
tomb
and
while
she
was
thus
occupied
he
entered
and
saluted
her
and
informed
her
that
he
was
her
husbands
brother
acquainting
her
with
what
had
passed
and
revealing
to
her
the
particulars
of
the
story
he
told
her
that
her
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
had
passed
a
whole
night
with
his
daughter
and
disappeared
in
the
morning
and
that
his
daughter
had
borne
him
a
son
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
when
she
heard
this
news
of
her
son
and
that
he
was
perhaps
still
living
and
beheld
her
husbands
brother
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
kissed
them
addressing
him
with
this
coupletâ

divinely
is
he
inspired
who
acquainteth
me
with
their
approach
for
he
hath
brought
information
most
delightful
to
be
heard
if
he
would
be
satisfied
with
that
which
is
cast
off61
i
would
give
him
a
heart
rent
in
pieces
at
the
hour
of
valediction
263
the
wezeer
then
sent
to
bring
ajeeb
and
when
he
came
his
grandmother
rose
to
him
and
embraced
him
and
wept
but
shems-ed-deen
said
to
her
this
is
not
a
time
for
weeping
but
rather
a
time
for
preparing
thyself
to
accompany
us
on
our
return
to
the
land
of
egypt
and
perhaps
god
may
unite
us
with
thy
son
my
nephew
she
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
arising
immediately
collected
all
her
property
and
treasures
and
her
female
slaves
and
forthwith
prepared
herself
after
which
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen
went
up
again
to
the
suláÃn
of
el-baárah
and
took
leave
of
him
and
the
king
sent
with
him
presents
and
rarities
for
the
suláÃn
of
egypt

the
widow
of
noor-ed-deen
kissing
the
feet
of
his
brother
the
wezeer
departed
without
delay
accompanied
by
his
brothers
wife
and
continued
his
journey
until
he
arrived
at
the
city
of
damascus
where
he
alighted
again
and
encamped
and
said
to
his
attendants
we
will
remain
at
damascus
a
week
to
buy
for
the
suláÃn
presents
and
rarities
ajeeb
then
said
to
the
eunuch
boy62
i
long
for
a
little
diversion
arise
therefore
and
let
us
go
to
the
market
of
damascus
and
see
what
is
going
on
there
and
what
hath
happened
to
that
cook
whose
confection
we
ate
and
whose
head
we
broke
notwithstanding
he
had
treated
us
with
kindness
we
acted
ill
towards
him
the
eunuch
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
ajeeb
went
forth
with
him
from
the
tents
the
tie
of
blood
inciting
him
to
visit
his
father
and
they
entered
the
city
and
proceeded
to
the
shop
of
the
cook
whom
they
found
standing
there
it
was
then
near
the
time
of264
afternoon-prayers
and
it
happened
that
he
had
again
just
prepared
a
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
and
when
they
drew
near
to
him
the
heart
of
ajeeb
yearned
towards
him
when
he
saw
him
and
he
perceived
the
scar
occasioned
by
the
stone
that
he
had
thrown
he
said
to
him
peace
be
on
thee
know
that
my
heart
is
with
theeâand
when
bedr-ed-deen
beheld
him
his
affections
were
engrossed
by
him
and
his
heart
throbbed
with
emotion
towards
him
and
he
hung
down
his
head
desiring
to
adapt
his
tongue
to
speech
and
unable
to
do
so
but
presently
he
raised
his
head
and
looking
towards
the
youth
in
an
humble
and
abject
manner
recited
these
versesâ

i
wished
for
my
beloved
but
when
i
beheld
him
i
was
confounded
and
possessed
neither
tongue
nor
eye
i
hung
down
my
head
in
honour
and
reverence
and
would
have
hidden
what
i
felt
but
it
would
not
be
concealed
i
had
prepared
a
volume
of
expostulation
but
when
we
met
i
remembered
not
a
word
he
then
said
to
them
refresh
ye
my
heart
and
eat
of
my
food
for
by
allah
as
soon
as
i
beheld
thee
my
heart
yearned
towards
thee
and
i
had
not
followed
thee
unless
i
had
been
deprived
of
my
reasonâby
allah
replied
ajeeb
thou
dost
indeed
love
us
and
we
ate
a
morsel
with
thee
but
after
it
thou
keptest
close
behind
us
and
wouldst
have
disgraced
us
we
will
not
eat
again
with
thee
therefore
but
on
the
condition
of
thy
swearing
that
thou
wilt
not
follow
us
and
otherwise
we
will
not
come
to
thee
again
henceforth
for
we
are
staying
at
this
city
a
week
in
order
that
my
grandfather
may
procure
presents
for
the
kingâi
bind
myself
said
bedr-ed-deen
to
do
as
ye
desire
so
ajeeb
entered
the
shop
with
the
eunuch
and
bedr-ed-deen
placed
before
them
a
saucer
filled
with
the
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
upon
which
ajeeb
said
to
him
eat
with
us
and
may
god
dispel
our
afflictionâand
bedr-ed-deen
was
delighted
and
he
ate
with
them
but
he
turned
not
his
eyes
from
the
youth
for
his
heart
and
all
his
faculties
were
captivated
by
him
ajeeb
observing
this
said
to
him
knowest
thou
not
that
i
told
thee
thou
wast
a
rude
doter
enough
of
this
continue
not
to
gaze
at
my
faceâbedr-ed-deen
therefore
apologized
to
him
and
began
to
put
morsels
into
the
mouth
of
ajeeb
and
then
did
the
same
to
the
eunuch
afterwards
he
poured
the
water
upon
their
hands
and
when
they
had
washed
he
loosed
a
napkin
of
silk
from
his
waist
and
wiped
them
with
it
he
next
sprinkled
rose-water
upon
them
from
a
bottle
that
was
in
his
shop
and
went
out
and
returned
with
two
cups
of
sherbet
prepared
with
rose-water265
infused
with
musk
and
placing
these
before
them
he
said
complete
your
kindness
so
ajeeb
took
a
cup
and
drank
and
bedr-ed-deen
handed
the
other
to
the
eunuch
and
both
drank
until
their
stomachs
were
full
and
gratified
their
appetites
to
a
degree
beyond
their
usual
habit

bedr-ed-deen
waiting
upon
his
son
and
the
eunuch
they
then
departed
and
hastened
back
to
the
tents
and
ajeeb
went
in
to
his
grandmother
the
mother
of
his
father
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
and
she
kissed
him
and
said
where
hast
thou
been
he
answered
in
the
city
and
she
arose
and
brought
him
a
saucer
of
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
which
happened
to
be
somewhat
deficient
in
sweetness
and
she
said
to
the
eunuch
sit
down
with
thy
master
the
eunuch
said
within
himself
by
allah
we
have
no
appetite
he
however
seated
himself
and
ajeeb
did
the
same
though
satiated
with
what
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
dipped
a
morsel
of
bread
in
the
confection
and
ate
it
but
it
seemed
to
him
insipid
on
account
of
his
being
thus
cloyed
and
he
loathed
it
and
said
what
is
this
nasty
dishâo
my
child
said
his
grandmother
dost
thou
find
fault
with
my
cookery
it
was
i
who
prepared
it
and
except
thy
father
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
there
is
none
who
can
cook
it
as
well
as
myselfâby
allah
o
my
mistress
replied
ajeeb
this
thy
dish
is
not
well
prepared
we
have
just
now
seen
in
the
city
a
cook
who
had
prepared
a
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
but
its
odour
was
such
as
to
dilate
the
heart
and
the
confection
itself
such
as
to
excite
appetite
in
one
already
satiated
as
to
thine
in
comparison
with
his
it
is
good
for
nothing

his
grandmother
on
hearing
this
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
turning
towards
the
eunuch
said
to
him
wo
to
thee
hast
thou
corrupted
my
child
thou
hast
taken
him
into
the
shops
of
the266
cooksâthe
eunuch
feared
and
denied
saying
we
did
not
enter
the
shop
but
only
passed
by
itâbut
ajeeb
said
by
allah
we
entered
and
ate
and
what
we
ate
was
better
than
this
mess
of
thine
and
upon
this
his
grandmother
arose
and
informed
her
husbands
brother
and
incensed
him
against
the
eunuch
the
slave
was
therefore
brought
before
the
wezeer
and
he
said
to
him
wherefore
didst
thou
take
my
child
into
the
cooks
shop
the
eunuch
fearing
said
again
we
did
not
enterânay
said
ajeeb
we
did
enter
and
ate
of
a
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
until
we
were
satiated
and
the
cook
gave
us
to
drink
sherbet
with
ice
and
sugar
the
wezeers
anger
with
the
eunuch
now
increased
and
he
asked
him
again
but
still
he
denied
then
said
the
wezeer
if
thine
assertion
be
true
sit
down
and
eat
before
us
the
eunuch
therefore
advanced
and
would
have
eaten
but
he
could
not
and
he
threw
down
the
morsel
that
was
in
his
hand
and
said
o
my
master
i
am
satiated
since
yesterday
and
by
this
the
wezeer
knew
that
he
had
eaten
in
the
shop
of
the
cook
so
he
ordered
the
female
slaves
to
throw
him
down
upon
the
ground
and
they
did
so
and
he
gave
him
a
severe
beating
while
the
slave
cried
for
mercy
but
still
saying
i
am
satiated
since
yesterday
the
wezeer
then
interrupted
the
beating
and
said
to
him
declare
the
truth
and
at
length
the
eunuch
said
know
that
we
did
enter
the
shop
of
the
cook
while
he
was
cooking
pomegranate-grains
and
he
ladled
out
for
us
some
of
the
confection
and
by
allah
i
never
in
my
life
ate
any
like
it
or
any
more
detestable
than
this
which
is
before
us

the
mother
of
bedr-ed-deen
enraged
at
this
said
thou
shalt
go
to
this
cook
and
bring
us
a
saucerful
of
his
confection
and
shew
it
to
thy
master
that
he
may
say
which
of
the
two
is
the
better
and
the
more
deliciousâwell
replied
the
eunuch
and
immediately
she
gave
him
a
saucer
and
half
a
piece
of
gold
and
he
went
to
the
shop
and
said
to
the
cook
we
have
laid
a
wager
respecting
thy
confection
at
the
tent
of
our
master
for
there
is
a
mess
of
pomegranate-grains
cooked
by
the
family
give
us
therefore
for
this
half-piece
of
gold
and
apply
thyself
to
prepare
it
perfectly
for
we
have
received
an
excruciating
beating
on
account
of
thy
cookery
laughing
at
these
words
bedr-ed-deen
replied
by
allah
none
excelleth
in
the
preparation
of
this
confection
except
myself
and
my
mother
and
she
is
now
in
a
distant
country
and
he
ladled
out
as
much
as
filled
the
saucer
and
perfected
it
by
the
addition
of
some
musk
and
rose-water
the
eunuch
then
hastened
back
with
it
to
the
family
and
the
mother
of
áasan
took
it
and
tasting
its
delicious
flavour
immediately
knew267
who
had
prepared
it
and
shrieked
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
wezeer
was
amazed
at
the
event
and
they
sprinkled
some
rose-water
upon
her
and
when
she
recovered
she
said
if
my
son
be
yet
in
the
world
no
one
but
he
cooked
this
confection
he
is
my
son
áasan
bedr-ed-deen
without
doubt
for
none
but
he
can
prepare
this
except
myself
and
it
was
i
who
taught
him
to
do
it

bedr-ed-deen
bound
when
the
wezeer
heard
these
words
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
exclaimed
oh
how
i
long
to
behold
my
brothers
son
will
fortune
indeed
unite
us
with
him
but
i
look
not
for
our
union
from
any
but
god
whose
name
be
exaltedâand
he
instantly
arose
and
called
out
to
his
male
attendants
saying
let
twenty
men
of
you
go
to
the
shop
of
the
cook
and
demolish
it
and
bind
his
hands
behind
him
with
his
turban
and
drag
him
hither
by
force
but
without
any
injury
to
his
person
they
replied
well
the
wezeer
then
rode
immediately
to
the
palace
and
presenting
himself
before
the
viceroy
of
damascus
shewed
him
the
contents
of
the
letters
which
he
had
brought
from
the
suláÃn
and
the
viceroy
after
kissing
them
put
them
to
his
head
and
said
who
is
thine
offender
he
answered
a
man
who
is
by
trade
a
cook
and
instantly
the
viceroy
ordered
his
chamberlains
to
repair
to
his
shop
and
they
went
thither
but
found
it
demolished
and
everything
that
had
been
in
it
broken
for
when
the
wezeer
went
to
the
palace
his
servants
did
as
he
had
commanded
them
they268
were
then
waiting
his
return
from
the
palace
and
bedr-ed-deen
was
saying
within
himself
what
can
they
have
discovered
in
the
confection
that
such
an
event
as
this
should
have
befallen
me
and
when
the
wezeer
returned
from
the
viceroy
and
had
received
his
permission
to
take
his
offender
and
to
depart
with
him
he
entered
the
encampment
and
called
for
the
cook
they
brought
him
therefore
with
his
hands
bound
behind
him
with
his
turban
and
when
he
saw
his
uncle
he
wept
bitterly
and
said
o
my
master
what
crime
have
ye
found
in
me
the
wezeer
said
to
him
art
thou
he
who
cooked
the
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
he
answered
yes
and
have
ye
found
in
it
anything
that
requires
ones
head
to
be
struck
off
this
replied
the
wezeer
is
the
smallest
part
of
thy
recompenseâwilt
thou
not
said
bedr-ed-deen
acquaint
me
with
my
crime
the
wezeer
answered
yea
immediately
and
forthwith
he
called
out
to
the
young
men
saying
bring
the
camels

they
then
took
bedr-ed-deen
and
put
him
in
a
chest
and
having
locked
him
up
in
it
commenced
their
journey
and
continued
on
their
way
till
the
approach
of
night
when
they
halted
and
ate
and
taking
out
bedr-ed-deen
fed
him
after
which
they
put
him
again
into
the
chest
and
in
like
manner
proceeded
to
another
station
here
also
they
took
him
out
and
the
wezeer
said
to
him
art
thou
he
who
cooked
the
confection
of
pomegranate
grains
he
answered
yes
o
my
master
and
the
wezeer
said
shackle
his
feet
and
they
did
so
and
restored
him
to
the
chest
they
then
continued
their
journey
to
cairo
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
quarter
called
er-reydÃneeyeh63
the
wezeer
commanded
to
take
out
bedr-ed-deen
again
from
the
chest
and
to
bring
a
carpenter
to
whom
he
said
make
for
this
man
a
cross64âwhat
said
bedr-ed-deen
dost
thou
mean
to
do
with
it
the
wezeer
answered
i
will
crucify
thee
upon
it
and
nail
thee
to
it
and
then
parade
thee
about
the
cityâwherefore
demanded
bedr-ed-deen
wilt
thou
treat
me
thusâthe
wezeer
replied
for
thy
faulty
preparation
of
the
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
because
thou
madest
it
deficient
in
pepperâbecause
of
its
deficiency
in
pepper
exclaimed
bedr-ed-deen
wilt
thou
do
all
this
to
me
art
thou
not
satisfied
with
having
thus
imprisoned
me
and
fed
me
every
day
with
only
one
mealâthe
wezeer
answered
for
its
deficiency
in
pepper
thy
recompense
shall
be
nothing
less
than
death
and
bedr-ed-deen
was
amazed
and
bewailed
his
lot
and
remained
a
while
absorbed
in
reflection
the
wezeer
therefore
said
to
him
of
what
art
thou
thinking
he
answered
of
imbecile
minds
such
as
thine
for
if269
thou
wert
a
man
of
sense
thou
wouldst
not
have
treated
me
in
this
manner
on
account
of
the
deficiency
of
pepperâit
is
incumbent
on
us
replied
the
wezeer
to
punish
thee
that
thou
mayest
not
do
the
like
againâto
which
bedr-ed-deen
rejoined
the
least
of
the
things
thou
hast
done
to
me
were
a
sufficient
punishment
the
wezeer
however
said
thy
death
is
unavoidableâall
this
conversation
took
place
while
the
carpenter
was
preparing
the
cross
and
bedr-ed-deen
was
looking
on

thus
they
both
continued
until
the
approach
of
night
when
bedr-ed-deens
uncle
took
him
and
put
him
again
into
the
chest
saying
to-morrow
shall
be
thy
crucifixion
he
then
waited
until
he
perceived
that
he
was
asleep
upon
which
he
remounted
and
with
the
chest
borne
before
him
entered
the
city
and
repaired
to
his
house
and
when
he
had
arrived
there
he
said
to
his
daughter
sitt-el-áosn
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
restored
to
thee
the
son
of
thine
uncle
arise
and
furnish
the
house
as
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
bridal
displayâshe
therefore
ordered
her
female
slaves
to
do
so
and
they
arose
and
lighted
the
candles
and
the
wezeer
brought
out
the
paper
upon
which
he
had
written
his
inventory
of
the
furniture
of
the
house
and
read
it
and
ordered
them
to
put
every
thing
in
its
place
so
that
the
beholder
would
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
very
night
of
the
bridal
display
he
directed
them
to
put
bedr-ed-deens
turban
in
the
place
where
its
owner
had
deposited
it
and
in
like
manner
the
trousers
and
the
purse
which
was
beneath
the
mattress
and
ordered
his
daughter
to
adorn
herself
as
she
was
on
the
bridal
night
and
to
enter
the
bride-chamber
saying
to
her
when
the
son
of
thine
uncle
comes
into
thy
chamber
say
to
him
thou
hast
loitered
since
thou
withdrewest
from
me
this
nightâand
request
him
to
return
and
converse
with
thee
till
dayâhaving
thus
arranged
everything
the
wezeer
took
out
bedr-ed-deen
from
the
chest
removed
the
shackles
from
his
feet
and
stripped
him
of
his
outer
clothes
leaving
him
in
his
shirt

all
this
was
done
while
he
was
asleep
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
and
when
he
awoke
and
found
himself
in
an
illuminated
vestibule
he
said
within
himself
am
i
bewildered
by
dreams
or
am
i
awake
then
rising
he
advanced
a
little
way
to
an
inner
door
and
looked
and
lo
he
was
in
the
house
in
which
the
bride
had
been
displayed
and
he
beheld
the
bride-chamber
and
the
couch
and
his
turban
and
clothes
confounded
at
the
sight
of
these
things
he
took
one
step
forwards
and
another
backwards
thinking
am
i
asleep
or
awake
and
he
began
to
wipe
his
forehead
and
exclaimed
in
his
astonishment270

bedr-ed-deens
perplexity
by
allah
this
is
the
dwelling
of
the
bride
who
was
here
displayed
before
me
and
yet
i
was
just
now
in
a
chest
and
while
he
was
addressing
himself
behold
sitt-el-áosn
lifted
up
the
corner
of
the
musquito
curtain
and
said
o
my
master
wilt
thou
not
come
in
for
thou
hast
loitered
since
thou
withdrewest
from
me
this
night
when
he
heard
these
words
he
looked
at
her
face
and
laughed
and
said
verily
these
appearances
are
bewildering
illusions
of
a
dream
then
entering
he
sighed
and
as
he
reflected
upon
what
had
happened
to
him
he
was
perplexed
at
his
situation
and
his
case
seemed
involved
in
obscurity
looking
at
his
turban
and
trousers
and
the
purse
containing
the
thousand
pieces
of
gold
he
exclaimed
allah
is
all-knowingâbut
it
seemeth
to
me
that
i
am
bewildered
by
dreamsâand
he
was
confounded
in
the
excess
of
his
astonishment
upon
this
therefore
sitt-el-áosn
said
to
him
wherefore
do
i
behold
thee
thus
astonished
and
perplexed
thou
wast
not
so
in
the
commencement
of
the
nightâand
he
laughed
and
asked
her
how
many
years
have
i
been
absent
from
theeâallah
preserve
thee
she
exclaimed
the
name
of
allah
encompass
thee65
thou
hast
only
withdrawn
to
yonder
apartment
what
hath
passed
in
thy
mindâon
hearing
this
he
smiled
and
replied
thou
hast
spoken
truth
but
when
i
withdrew
from
thee
sleep
overcame
me
and
i
dreamt
that
i
was
a
cook
in
damascus
and
that
i
lived
there
twelve
years66
and
i
thought271
that
a
youth
of
the
sons
of
the
great
came
to
me
accompanied
by
a
eunuchâand
he
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
in
consequence
of
this
youths
visit
then
drawing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
felt
the
scar
occasioned
by
the
blow
and
exclaimed
by
allah
o
my
mistress
it
seemeth
as
though
it
were
true
for
he
struck
me
with
a
stone
upon
my
forehead
and
cut
it
open
it
seemeth
therefore
as
though
this
had
really
happened
when
i
was
awake
but
probably
this
dream
occurred
when
we
were
both
asleep
i
imagined
in
my
dream
that
i
was
transported
to
damascus
without
áarboosh
or
turban
or
trousers
and
that
i
followed
the
occupation
of
a
cookâand
again
for
a
while
he
remained
utterly
confounded
he
then
said
by
allah
i
imagined
that
i
made
a
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
containing
but
little
pepper
verily
i
must
have
been
asleep
and
in
my
sleep
have
seen
all
thisâi
conjure
thee
by
allah
said
sitt-el-áosn
tell
me
what
more
thou
sawest
and
he
related
to
her
the
whole
and
added
if
i
had
not
awaked
they
would
have
crucified
me
upon
a
wooden
crossâon
account
of
what
said
she
he
answered
on
account
of
the
deficiency
of
pepper
in
the
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
and
i
imagined
that
they
demolished
my
shop
and
broke
all
my
vessels
and
put
me
in
a
chest
and
brought
the
carpenter
to
make
a
cross
of
wood
for
they
intended
to
crucify
me
upon
it
praise
be
to
god
therefore
who
caused
all
this
to
occur
to
me
in
sleep
and
caused
it
not
to
happen
to
me
when
i
was
awakeâsitt-el-áosn
laughing
at
his
words
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
and
he
in
like
manner
embraced
her
then
reflecting
again
he
said
by
allah
it
seems
as
if
it
had
happened
when
i
was
awake
and
i
knew
not
the
reason
nor
the
truth
of
the
caseâand
he
composed
himself
to
sleep
perplexed
with
his
case
and
sometimes
saying
i
saw
it
in
my
sleepâand
other
times
i
experienced
it
awake

thus
he
continued
until
the
morning
when
his
uncle
the
wezeer
shems-ed-deen
came
in
to
him
and
saluted
him
and
bedr-ed-deen
as
soon
as
he
beheld
him
exclaimed
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
tell
me
art
not
thou
he
who
gave
orders
to
bind
my
hands
behind
me
and
to
nail
up
my
shop
on
account
of
the
confection
of
pomegranate-grains
because
it
was
deficient
in
pepper
the
wezeer
answered
know
o
my
son
that
the
truth
hath
appeared
and
what
was
hidden
hath
been
manifested
thou
art
the
son
of
my
brother
and
i
did
not
this
but
to
know
if
thou
wert
he
who
visited
my
daughter
on
that
night
i
was
not
convinced
of
this
until
i
saw
that
thou
knewest
the
house
and
thy
turban
and
trousers
and
gold
and
the
two
papers
namely272
the
one
which
thou
wrotest
and
that
which
thy
father
my
brother
wrote
for
i
had
never
seen
thee
before
and
therefore
knew
thee
not
and
as
to
thy
mother
i
have
brought
her
with
me
from
el-baárahâhaving
thus
said
he
threw
himself
upon
him
and
wept
and
bedr-ed-deen
full
of
astonishment
at
his
uncles
words
embraced
him
and
in
like
manner
wept
from
excess
of
joy
the
wezeer
then
said
to
him
o
my
son
the
cause
of
all
this
was
what
passed
between
me
and
thy
father
and
he
related
to
him
the
circumstances
of
their
case
and
the
cause
of
his
fathers
departure
to
el-baárah
after
which
he
sent
for
ajeeb
and
when
the
father
of
the
youth
saw
him
he
exclaimed
this
is
he
who
threw
the
stone
at
meâthis
said
the
wezeer
is
thy
son
and
bedr-ed-deen
cast
himself
upon
him
and
recited
the
following
versesâ

long
have
i
wept
on
account
of
our
disunion
the
tears
overflowing
from
my
eyelids
and
i
vowed
that
if
providence
should
bring
us
together
i
would
never
again
mention
our
separation
joy
hath
overcome
me
to
such
a
degree
that
by
its
excess
it
hath
made
me
weep
o
eye
thou
hast
become
so
accustomed
to
tears
that
thou
weepest
from
happiness
as
from
grief67
and
when
he
had
uttered
these
words
his
mother
beholding
him
threw
herself
upon
him
and
repeated
this
coupletâ

fortune
made
a
vow
to
torment
me
incessantly
but
thine
oath
hath
proved
false
o
fortune
therefore
expiate
it68
happiness
hath
arrived
and
the
beloved
is
come
to
my
relief
repair
then
to
the
messenger
of
festivity
and
hasten
she
afterwards
related
to
him
everything
that
had
happened
to
her
and
he
also
acquainted
her
with
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
they
offered
up
thanks
to
god
for
their
union
the
wezeer
then
went
up
to
the
suláÃn
and
informed
him
of
these
occurrences
and
the
king
was
astonished
and
ordered
that
a
statement
of
them
should
be
inserted
in
the
records
to
be
preserved
to
future
ages
and
the
wezeer
resided
with
his
brothers
son
and
his
own
daughter
and
her
son
and
with
the
wife
of
his
brother
and
all
of
them
passed
their
lives
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
utmost
happiness
until
they
were
visited
by
the
terminator
of
delights
and
the
separator
of
companions69

that
these

be

from
the
mouth
of
a
learned
man
complaining
of
the
unprofitableness
of
his
science
with
respect
to
procuring
him
money
but
perhaps
in
writing
this
he
was
actuated
by
a
somewhat
over-zealous
regard
for
the
honour
of
his
own
profession
for
when
a
poor
man
has
acquired
a
little
knowledge
his
neighbours
are
apt
to
flatter
him

it

denies
his

generally

feet
for
this
purpose
the

are
confined
by
a
chain
or

attached
at

which
is
turned

this
is
called
a

is

remark

that

must
not

alone
enables

to
form
a
decided
judgment
as
to
the
period
when
this

it

the

was
composed

the
tale
here
presents
another
anachronism
the

borne
by

in

two
hundred

after
the
death
of

was

year
of
the

of
a
little
later
the
first
being
the
famous
áalÃá-ed-deen
or
saladin

i
have
now
given
several
data
upon
which
to
found
a
reasonable
opinion
as
to
the
275age
when
these
tales
in
the
states
in
which
they
are
known
to
us
were
composed
or
compiled
or
remodelled
first
in
note
55
to
chapter
ii
i
have
shewn
that
a
fiction
in
one
of
the
tales
is
framed
in
accordance
with
the
distinction
of
muslims
christians
and
jews
by
the
colours
of
their
turbans
which
mode
of
distinction
originated
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
century
of
the
flight
secondly
in
the
present
note
i
have
mentioned
a
fact
which
affords
some
reason
for
inferring
that
there
had
been
a
long
series
of
suláÃns
in
egypt
before
the
age
of
the
writer
or
writers
in
the
third
place
i
must
remark
that
all
the
events
described
in
this
work
are
said
to
have
happened
in
ages
which
with
respect
to
that
of
the
writer
or
writers
were
ancient
being
related
to
an
ancient
king
from
which
i
think
we
may
infer
its
age
to
have
been
at
least
two
centuries
posterior
to
the
period
mentioned
in
the
first
of
these
data
fourthly
in
note
22
to
chapter
iii
i
have
shewn
that
the
state
of
manners
and
morals
described
in
many
of
these
tales
agrees
in
a
most
important
point
of
view
with
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
arabs
at
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
century
of
the
flight
this
i
regard
as
an
argument
of
great
weight
and
especially
satisfactory
as
agreeing
with
the
inference
just
before
drawn
fifthly
from
what
i
have
stated
in
the
note
immediately
preceding
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
few
of
the
copies
of
this
work
now
known
to
us
if
any
were
written
until
after
the
conquest
of
egypt
by
the
turks
in
the
year
1517
of
our
era
this
opinion
it
should
be
remarked
respects
especially
the
early
portion
of
the
work
which
is
the
least
likely
to
have
been
interpolated
as
later
parts
evidently
have
been
at
the
last-mentioned
period
a
native
of
cairo
in
which
city
i
believe
the
principal
portion
of
the
work
to
have
been
written
might
if
about
forty
years
of
age
retain
a
sufficient
recollection
of
the
later
memlook
suláÃns
and
of
their
ministers
to
describe
his
kings
and
courts
without
the
necessity
of
consulting
the
writings
of
historians
deriving
his
knowledge
of
early
times
not
from
the
perusal
of
any
regular
record
but
only
from
traditions
or
from
works
like
the
presentâi
should
have
delayed
the
insertion
of
the
foregoing
remarks
had
i
not
considered
it
a
point
of
some
importance
to
suggest
to
the
reader
as
early
as
possible
that
the
manners
and
customs
and
in
general
even
the
dresses
and
dwellings
described
in
most
of
the
present
tales
are
those
of
a
very
late
period
the
lax
state
of
morals
which
appears
to
have
prevailed
among
the
arabs
in
the
time
of
the
writer
or
writers
probably
continued
at
least
until
the
period
when
coffee
became
a
common
beverage
about
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
of
the
flight
or
near
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
of
our
era
and
perhaps
considerably
later
until
some
years
after
the
introduction
of
tobacco
into
the
east
the
researches
of
von
hammer
have
satisfactorily
shewn
that
the
thousand
and
one
nights
in
the
states
in
which
it
is
known
to
us
is
based
upon
a
very
old
work
in
persian
an
arabic
translation
of
which
bore
a
similar
or
perhaps
the
same
title
as
that
which
we
are
considering

i
believe
the

to
be
in
its

it
was
formerly
a

perhaps
is
still
among
some
for
the

to
his

holding

there
is

will
give
him
in

a

take

the
name
of
the
eldest
of
his
children
nor
take
any
such
surname
before
a
child
is
born
to
him280âthe
custom
of
naming
children
after
prophets
or
after
relations
or
companions
of
moáammad
is
very
common
no
ceremony
is
observed
on
account
of
the
naming

on
the
same
day
however
two
practices
which
i
am
about
to
mention
are
prescribed
to
be
observed
though
as
far
as
my
observations
and
inquiries
allow
me
to
judge
they
are
generally
neglected
by
the
modern
muslims
the
first
of
these
is
a
sacrifice
the
victim
is
called
aáeeáah
it
should
be
a
ram
or
goat
or
two
such
animals
should
be
sacrificed
for
a
son
and
one
for
a
daughter
this
rite
is
regarded
by
ibn-áambal
as
absolutely
obligatory
he
said
if
a
father
sacrifice
not
for
his
son
and
he
the
son
die
that
son
will
not
intercede
for
him
on
the
day
of
judgment
the
founders
of
the
three
other
principal
sects
regard
it
in
different
and
less
important
lights
though
mohammad
slew
an
aáeeáah
for
himself
after
his
prophetic
mission
the
person
should
say
on
slaying
the
victim
o
god
verily
this
aáeekah
is
a
ransom
for
my
son
such
a
one
its
blood
for
his
blood
and
its
flesh
for
his
flesh
and
its
bone
for
his
bone
and
its
skin
for
his
skin
and
its
hair
for
his
hair
o
god
make
it
a
ransom
for
my
son
from
hell-fire
a
bone
of
the
victim
should
not
be
broken281
the
midwife
should
receive
a
leg
of
it
it
should
be
cooked
without
previously
cutting
off
any
portion
of
it
and
part
of
it
should
be
given
in
almsâafter
this
should
be
performed
the
other
ceremony
above
alluded
to
which
is
this
it
is
a
sunneh
ordinance
incumbent
on
the
father
to
shave
or
cause
to
be
shaved
the
head
of
his
child
and
to
give
in
alms
to
the
poor
the
weight
of
the
hair
in
gold
or
silver
this
should
also
be
done
for
a
proselyte282
on
the
subsequent
occasions
of
shaving
the
head
of
a
male
child
for
the
head
of
the
male
is
frequently
shaven
a
tuft
of
hair
is
generally
left
on
the
crown
and
commonly
for
several
years
another
also
over
the
forehead

circumcision
is
most
approved
if
performed
on
the
same
day283
but
the
observance
of
this
rite
is
generally
delayed
until
the
child
has
attained
the
age
of
five
or
six
years
and
sometimes
several
years
later
i
shall
therefore
delay
mentioning
the
ceremonies
with
which
it
is
celebrated

the
muslims
rightly
regard
a
child
as
a
trust
committed
by
god
to
its
parents
who
they
hold
are
responsible
for
the
manner
in
which
they
bring
it
up
and
will
be
examined
on
this
subject
on
the
day
of
judgment
but
they
further
venture
to
say
that
the
first
who
will
lay
hold
of
a
man
on
the
day
of
judgment
will
be
his
wife
and
278children
who
if
he
have
been
deficient
in
his
duty
to
them
will
present
themselves
before
god
and
say
o
our
lord
take
for
us
our
due
from
him
for
he
taught
us
not
that
of
which
we
were
ignorant
and
he
fed
us
with
forbidden
food
and
we
knew
not
and
their
due
will
be
taken
from
him284
by
this
is
meant
that
a
certain
proportion
of
the
good
works
which
the
man
may
have
done
and
his
children
and
wife
neglected
will
be
set
down
to
their
account
or
that
a
similar
proportion
of
their
evil
works
will
be
transferred
to
his
account

the
mother
is
enjoined
by
the
law
to
give
suck
to
her
child
two
full
years
unless
she
have
her
husbands
consent
to
shorten
the
period
or
to
employ
another
nurse
for
suckling
the
child
a
virtuous
woman
who
eateth
only
what
is
lawful
should
be
chosen
for
the
unlawful
food
will
manifest
its
evil
in
the
child
as
the
prophet

said
giving
suck
altereth
the
tempers
but
it
is
recommended
by
the
sunneh
that
the
mother
herself
suckle
the
child
for
it
is
said
in
a
tradition
there
is
nothing
better
for
a
child
than
its
mothers
milk
if
thou
wouldst
try
it
is
addedwhether
a
child
be
of
an
ingenuous
disposition
in
its
infancy
or
not
order
a
woman
who
is
not
its
mother
to
suckle
it
after
its
mother
has
done
so
and
if
it
drink
of
the
milk
of
the
woman
who
is
not
its
mother
it
is
not
of
an
ingenuous
disposition285

children
being
regarded
by
muslim
parents
as
enviable
blessings
are
to
them
objects
of
the
most
anxious
solicitude
to
guard
them
from
the
supposed
influence
of
the
envious
or
evil
eye
they
have
recourse
to
various
expedients
when
they
are
taken
abroad
they
are
usually
clad
in
the
most
slovenly
manner
and
left
unwashed
or
even
purposely
smeared
with
dirt
and
as
a
further
precaution
a
fantastic
cap
is
often
put
upon
the
childs
head
or
its
head-dress
is
decorated
with
one
or
more
coins
a
feather
a
gay
tassel
or
a
written
charm
or
two
sewed
up
in
leather
or
encased
in
gold
or
silver
or
some
other
appendage
to
attract
the
eye
that
so
the
infant
itself
may
pass
unnoticed
if
a
person
express
his
admiration
of
anothers
child
otherwise
than
by
some
pious
ejaculation
as
for
instance
by
praising
its
creator
with
the
exclamation
of
subáÃna-llÃh
or
mÃ
shÃa-llÃh
c
or
invoking
a
blessing
on
the
prophet
he
fills
the
mind
of
the
parent
with
apprehension
and
recourse
is
had
to
some
superstitious
ceremony
to
counteract
the
dreaded
influence
of
his
envious
glance
the
children
of
the
poor
are
less
exposed
to
this
imaginary
danger
from
their
unattractive
appearance
they
generally
have
little
clothing
or
none
whatever
and
are
extremely
dirty
it
is
partly
with
the
view
of
protecting
them
from
the
evil
eye
that
those
of
the
rich
are
so
long
confined
to
the
áareem
there
they
are
petted
and
pampered
for
several
years
at
least
until
they
are
of
age
to
go
to
school
but
most
of
them
are
instructed
at
home

the
children
of
the
muslims
are
taught
to
shew
to
their
fathers
a
degree
of
respect
which
might
be
deemed
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
a
tender
mutual
affection
but
i
believe
that
this
is
not
the
case
the
child
greets
the
father
in
the
morning
by
kissing
his
hand
and
then
usually
stands
before
him
in
a
respectful
attitude
with
the
left
hand
covered
by
the
right
to
receive
any
order
or
to
await
his
permission
to
depart
but
after
the
respectful
kiss
is
often
taken
on
the
lap
after
the
period
of
infancy
the
well-bred
son
seldom
sits
in
the
presence
of
his
father
but
during
that
period
he
is
generally
allowed
much
familiarity
a
syrian
merchant
who
was
one
of
my
near
neighbours
in
cairo
had
a
child
of
exquisite
beauty
commonly
supposed
to
be
his
daughter
whom
though
he
was
a
most
bigoted
muslim
he
daily
took
with
him
from
his
private
house
to
his
shop
the
child
followed
him
seated
upon
an
ass
before
a
black
slave
and
until
about
six
years
old
was
dressed
like
most
young
ladies
but
without
a
face-veil
the
father
then
thinking
that
the
appearance
of
taking
about
with
him
a
daughter
of
that
age
was
scandalous
dressed
his
pet
as
a
boy
and
told
his
friends
that
the
female
attire
had
been
employed
as
a
protection
against
the
evil
eye
girls
being
less
coveted
than
boys
this
indeed
is
sometimes
done
and
it
is
possible
that
such
might
have
been
the
case
in
this
instance
but
i
was
led
to
believe
that
it
279was
not
so
a
year
after
i
left
cairo
while
i
remained
there
i
continued
to
see
the
child
pass
my
house
as
before
but
always
in
boys
clothing

it
is
not
surprising
that
the
natives
of
arabian
countries
where
a
very
trifling
expense
is
required
to
rear
the
young
should
be
generally
desirous
of
a
numerous
offspring
a
motive
of
self-interest
conduces
forcibly
to
cherish
this
feeling
in
a
wife
for
she
is
commonly
esteemed
by
her
husband
in
proportion
to
her
fruitfulness
and
a
man
is
seldom
willing
to
divorce
a
wife
or
to
sell
a
slave
who
has
borne
him
a
child
a
similar
feeling
also
induces
in
both
parents
a
desire
to
obtain
offspring
and
renders
them
at
the
same
time
resigned
to
the
loss
of
such
of
their
children
as
die
in
tender
age
this
feeling
arises
from
their
belief
of
certain
services
of
greater
moment
than
the
richest
blessings
this
world
can
bestow
which
children
who
die
in
infancy
are
to
render
to
their
parents
the
prophet
is
related
to
have
said
the
infant
children
of
the
muslims
shall
assemble
at
the
scene
of
judgment
on
the
day
of
the
general
resurrection
when
all
creatures
shall
appear
for
the
reckoning
and
it
will
be
said
to
the
angels
go
ye
with
these
into
paradise
and
they
will
halt
at
the
gate
of
paradise
and
it
will
be
said
to
them
welcome
to
the
offspring
of
the
muslims
enter
ye
paradise
there
is
no
reckoning
to
be
made
with
you
and
they
will
reply
yea
and
our
fathers
and
our
mothers
but
the
guardians
of
paradise
will
say
verily
your
fathers
and
your
mothers
are
not
with
you
because
they
have
committed
faults
and
sins
for
which
they
must
be
reckoned
with
and
inquired
of
then
they
will
shriek
and
cry
at
the
gate
of
paradise
with
a
great
cry
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
who
is
all-knowing
respecting
them
will
say
what
is
this
cry
it
will
be
answered
o
our
lord
the
children
of
the
muslims
say
we
will
not
enter
paradise
but
with
our
fathers
and
our
mothers
whereupon
god
whose
name
be
exalted
will
say
pass
among
them
all
and
take
the
hands
of
your
parents
and
introduce
them
into
paradise
the
children
who
are
to
have
this
power
are
such
as
are
born
of
believers
and
die
without
having
attained
to
the
knowledge
of
sin
and
according
to
one
tradition
one
such
child
will
introduce
his
parents
into
paradise
such
infants
only
are
to
enter
paradise
for
of
the
children
who
die
in
infancy
those
of
believers
alone
are
they
who
would
believe
if
they
grew
to
years
of
discretion
on
the
same
authority
it
is
said
when
a
child
of
the
servant
of
god
dies
god
whose
name
be
exalted
saith
to
the
angels
have
ye
taken
the
child
of
my
servant
they
answer
yea
he
saith
have
ye
taken
the
child
of
his
heart
they
reply
yea
he
asketh
them
what
did
my
servant
say
they
answer
he
praised
thee
and
said
verily
to
god
we
belong
and
verily
unto
him
we
return
then
god
will
say
build
for
my
servant
a
house
in
paradise
and
name
it
the
house
of
praise
to
these
traditions
which
i
find
related
as
proofs
of
the
advantages
of
marriage
the
following
anecdote
which
is
of
a
similar
nature
is
added
a
certain
man
who
would
not
take
a
wife
awoke
one
day
from
his
sleep
and
demanded
to
be
married
saying
as
his
reason
i
dreamt
that
the
resurrection
had
taken
place
and
that
i
was
among
the
beings
collected
at
the
scene
of
judgment
but
was
suffering
a
thirst
that
stopped
up
the
passage
of
my
stomach
and
lo
there
were
youths
passing
through
the
assembly
having
in
their
hands
ewers
of
silver
and
cups
of
gold
and
giving
drink
to
one
person
after
another
so
i
stretched
forth
my
hand
to
one
of
them
and
said
give
me
to
drink
for
thirst
overpowereth
me
but
they
answered
thou
hast
no
child
among
us
we
give
drink
only
to
our
fathers
i
asked
them
who
are
ye
they
replied
we
are
the
deceased
infant
children
of
the
muslims286
especial
rewards
in
heaven
are
promised
to
mothers
when
a
woman
conceives
by
her
husband
said
the
prophet
she
is
called
in
heaven
a
martyr
ie
she
is
ranked
as
a
martyr
in
dignity
and
her
labour
in
child-bed
and
her
care
for
her
children
protect
her
from
hell-fire287

when
the
child
begins
to
speak
the
father
should
teach
him
first
the
kelimeh
or
profession
of
faith
there
is
no
deity
but
god
moáammad
is
gods
apostleâhe
280should
dictate
this
to
him
seven
times
then
he
should
instruct
him
to
say
wherefore
exalted
be
god
the
king
the
truth
there
is
no
deity
but
he
the
lord
of
the
honourable
throne288
he
should
teach
him
also
the
throne-verse289
and
the
closing
words
of
the
áashr
he
is
god
beside
whom
there
is
no
deity
the
king
the
holy
c290

as
soon
as
a
son
is
old
enough
his
father
should
teach
him
the
most
important
rules
of
decent
behaviour
placing
some
food
before
him
he
should
order
him
to
take
it
with
the
right
hand
the
left
being
employed
for
unclean
purposes
and
to
say
on
commencing
in
the
name
of
god
to
eat
what
is
next
to
him
and
not
to
hurry
nor
spill
any
of
the
food
upon
his
person
or
dress
he
should
teach
him
that
it
is
disgusting
to
eat
much
he
should
particularly
condemn
to
him
the
love
of
gold
and
silver
and
caution
him
against
covetousness
as
he
would
against
serpents
and
scorpions
and
forbid
his
spitting
in
an
assembly
and
committing
any
similar
breach
of
good
manners
talking
much
turning
his
back
upon
another
standing
in
an
indolent
attitude
and
speaking
ill
of
any
person
to
another
he
should
keep
him
from
bad
companions
teach
him
the
áur-Ãn
and
all
requisite
divine
and
prophetic
ordinances
and
instruct
him
in
the
arts
of
swimming
and
archery
and
in
some
virtuous
trade
for
trade
is
a
security
from
poverty
he
should
also
command
him
to
endure
patiently
the
chastisements
of
his
teacher
in
one
tradition
it
is
said
when
a
boy
attains
the
age
of
six
years
he
should
be
disciplined
and
when
he
attains
to
nine
years
he
should
be
put
in
a
separate
bed
and
when
he
attains
to
ten
years
he
should
be
beaten
for
neglecting
prayer
in
another
tradition
order
your
children
to
pray
at
seven
years
and
beat
them
for
neglecting
it
at
ten
and
put
them
in
separate
beds291

circumcision
which
has
before
been
mentioned
is
generally
performed
before
the
boy
is
submitted
to
the
instruction
of
the
schoolmaster292
previously
to
the
performance
of
this
rite
he
is
if
belonging
to
the
higher

middle
rank

paraded
about

habits
and
ornaments

with
a

turban
on
his
head
mounted
on
a
horse
preceded
by
musicians
and
followed
by
a
group
of
his
female
relations
and
friends
this
ceremony
is
observed
by
the
great
with
much
pomp
and
with
sumptuous
feasts

a
fÃªte
celebrated
on
the
occasion
of

circumcision
of
a
son
of
the
áÃáee
of
cairo
in
the
year
of
the
flight
1179

great

the
middle
of
the
court
with

the
public
were
amused
for
many
days
by
players
and
performers
of
various
kinds
and
when
the
youth
was
paraded
through
the
streets
he
was
attended
by
numerous
memlooks
with
their
richly-caparisoned
horses
and
splendid
arms
and
armour
and
military
band
and
by
a
number
of
other
youths
who
from
compliment
to
him
were
circumcised
afterwards
with
him
this
latter
custom
is
usual
on
such
occasions
and
so
also
is
the
sending
of
presents
such
as
those
above
mentioned
by
friends
acquaintances
and
tradespeople
at
a
fÃªte
of
this
kind
when
the
khaleefeh
el-muátedir
circumcised
five
of
his
sons
the
money
that
was
scattered
in
presents
amounted
to
six
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
or
about
Â300000
many
orphans
were
also
circumcised
on
the
same
day
and
were
presented
with
clothes
and
pieces
of
gold293
the
khaleefeh
above
mentioned
was
famous
for
his
magnificence
a
proof
of
which
i
have
given
in
a
former
note
at
the
more
approved
entertainments
which
are
given
in
celebration
of
a
circumcision

few
of
the
children
of
the
arabs
receive
much
instruction
in
literature
and
still
fewer
are
taught
even
the
rudiments
of
any
of
the
higher
sciences
but
there
are
numerous
schools
in
their
towns
and
one
at
least
in
almost
every
moderately
large
village
the
former
are
mostly
attached
to
mosques
and
other
public
buildings
and
together
with
those
buildings
endowed
by
princes
or
other
men
of
rank
or
wealthy
tradesmen
in
these
the
children
are
instructed
either
gratis
or
for
a
very
trifling
weekly
payment
which
all
parents
except
those
in
indigent
circumstances
can
easily
afford
the
schoolmaster
generally
teaches
nothing
more
than
to
read
and
to
recite
by
heart
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
after
committing
to
memory
the
first
chapter
of
the
sacred
volume
the
boy
learns
the
rest
in
the
inverse
order
of
their
arrangement
as
they
generally
decrease
in
length
writing
and
arithmetic
are
usually
taught
by
another
master
and
grammar
rhetoric
versification
logic
the
interpretation
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
the
whole
system
of
religion
and
law
with
all
other
knowledge
deemed
useful
which
seldom
includes
the
mere
elements
of
mathematics
are
attained
by
studying
at
a
collegiate
mosque
and
at
no
expense
for
the
professors
receive
no
pay
either
from
the
students
who
are
mostly
of
the
poorer
classes
or
from
the
funds
of
the
mosque

the
wealthy
often
employ
for
their
sons
a
private
tutor
and
when
he
has
taught
them
to
read
and
to
recite
the
áur-Ãn
engage
for
them
a
writing-master
and
then
send
them
to
the
college
but
among
this
class
polite
literature
is
more
considered
than
any
other
branch
of
knowledge
after
religion
such
an
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
some
of
their
favourite
poets
as
enables
a
man
to
quote
them
occasionally
in
society
is
regarded
by
the
arabs
as
essential
to
a
son
who
is
to
mix
in
genteel
company
and
to
this
acquirement
is
often
added
some
skill
in
the
art
of
versification
which
is
rendered
peculiarly
easy
by
the
copiousness
of
the
arabic
language
and
by
its
system
of
inflection
these
characteristics
of
their
noble
tongue
which
are
remarkably
exhibited
by
the
custom
common
among
the
arabs
of
preserving
the
same
rhyme
throughout
a
whole
poem
while
on
the
one
hand
they
have
given
an
admirable
freedom
to
the
compositions
of
men
of
true
poetic
genius
have
on
the
other
hand
mainly
contributed
to
the
degradation
of
arabic
poetry
to
an
arab
of
some
little
learning
it
is
almost
as
easy
to
speak
in
verse
as
in
prose
and
hence
he
often
intersperses
his
prose
writings
and
not
unfrequently
his
conversation
with
indifferent
verses
of
which
the
chief
merit
often
consists
in
puns
or
in
an
ingenious
use
of
several
words
nearly
the
same
in
sound
but
differing
in
sense
to
a
reader
unacquainted
with
the
arabic
language
it
is
necessary
to
explain
this
custom
otherwise
he
would
imagine
that
the
author
of
the
present
work
is
merely
indulging
in
a
dramatic
licence
inconsistent
with
a
true
delineation
of
manners
when
he
makes
a
person
suddenly
change
the
style
of
his
speech
from
prose
to
verse
and
then
revert
to
the
former

one
more
duty
of
a
father
to
a
son
i
should
here
mention
it
is
to
procure
for
him
a
wife
as
soon
as
he
has
arrived
at
a
proper
age
this
age
is
decided
by
some
to
be
twenty
years
though
many
young
men
marry
at
an
earlier
period
it
is
said
when
a
son
has
attained
the
age
of
twenty
years
his
father
if
able
should
marry
him
and
then
take
his
hand
and
say
i
have
disciplined
thee
and
taught
thee
and
married
thee
i
now
seek
refuge
with
god
from
thy
mischief
in
the
present
world
and
the
next
to
enforce
this
duty
the
following
tradition
is
urged
when
a
son
attains
to
the
age
of
puberty
and
his
father
does
not
marry
him
and
yet
is
able
to
do
so
if
the
youth
commit
an
improper
act
in
consequence
the
sin
of
it
is
between
the
twoâor
as
in
another
reportâon
the
father294
the
same
is
held
to
be
the
case
with
respect
to
a
daughter
who
has
attained
the
age
of
twelve
years295

the
female
children
of
the
arabs
are
seldom
taught
even
to
read
though
they
are
282admissible
at
the
daily
schools
in
which
the
boys
are
instructed
very
few
parents
allow
them
the
benefit
of
this
privilege
preferring
if
they
give
them
any
instruction
of
a
literary
kind
to
employ
a
sheykhah
or
learned
woman
to
teach
them
at
home
she
instructs
them
in
the
forms
of
prayer
and
teaches
them
to
repeat
by
heart
a
few
chapters
of
the
áur-Ãn
very
rarely
the
whole
book
parents
are
indeed
recommended
to
withhold
from
their
daughters
some
portions
of
the
áur-Ãn
to
teach
them
the
soorat
en-noor
or
24th
chapter
and
keep
from
them
the
soorat-yoosuf
12th
chapter
on
account
of
the
story
of
zeleekhÃ

and
yoosuf

and

prohibitions

threats

of
punishments
contained

in
schools
and
in
private
houses
singing
and
playing
upon
the
lute
which
were
formerly
not
uncommon
female
accomplishments
among
the
wealthy
arabs
are
now
almost
exclusively
confined
like
dancing
to
professional
performers
and
a
few
of
the
slaves
in
the
áareems
of
the
great
it
is
very
seldom
now
that
any
musical
instrument
is
seen
in
the
hand
of
an
arab
lady
except
a
kind
of
drum
called
darabukkeh
and
a
áÃr
or
tambourine
which
are
found
in
many
áareems
and
are
beaten
with
the
fingers297
some
care
however
is
bestowed
by
the
ladies
in
teaching
their
daughters
what
they
consider
an
elegant
gait
and
carriage
as
well
as
various
alluring
and
voluptuous
arts
with
which

increase
the
attachment
of
their

marriage
previously
to
the
perusal
of
the
first
description
of
a
nuptial
fÃªte
that
occurs
in
this
work
the
reader
may
perhaps
desire
some
introductory
information
which
i
shall
here
endeavour
to
convey
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
present
note
serve
to
illustrate
many
future
allusions
in
these
pages
and
not
merely
the
foregoing
tale

marriage
is
regarded
by
the
muslims
in
general
as
a
positive
duty
and
to
neglect
it
without
a
sufficient
excuse
subjects
a
man
to
severe
reproach
when
a
servant
of
god
said
the
prophet
marries
verily
he
perfects
half
his
religion298
he
once
asked
a
man
art
thou
married
the
man
answered
no
and
art
thou
said
he
sound
and
healthy
the
answer
was
yes
then
said
moáammad
thou
art
one
of
the
brothers
of
the
devils
for
the
most
wicked
among
you
are
the
unmarried
and
the
most
vile
among
your
dead
are
the
unmarried
moreover
the
married
are
those
who
are
acquitted
of
filthy
conversation
and
by
him
in
whose
hand
is
my
soul
the
devil
hath
not
a
weapon
more
effective
against
the
virtuous
both
men
and
women
than
the
neglect
of
marriage299
some
remarks
on
this
subject
and
on
the
advantages
of
marriage
have
been
made
in
a
preceding
note
on
infancy
and
education

the
number
of
wives
whom
a
muslim
may
have
at
the
same
time
is
four
he
may
marry
free
women
or
take
concubine
slaves
or
have
of
both
these
classes
it
is
the
opinion
of
most
persons
i
believe
among
the
more
strictly
religious
that
a
man
may
not
have
more
than
four
women
whether
they
be
wives
alone
or
concubine
slaves
alone
or
of
both
classes
together
but
the
practice
of
some
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
who
cannot
be
accused
of
violating
his
precepts
affords
a
strong
argument
to
the
contrary
alee
it
is
said
was
the
most
devout
of
the
companions
but
he
had
four
wives
and
seventeen
concubines
besides
and
married
after
fÃáimeh
may
god
be
well
pleased
with
her
among
all
that
he
married
and
divorced
more
than
two
hundred
women
and
sometimes
he
included
four
wives
in
one
contract
and
sometimes
divorced
four
at
one
time
taking
other
four
in
their
stead300
this
may
perhaps
be
an
exaggerated
statement
but
it
is
certain
that
the
custom
of
keeping
an
unlimited
number
of
concubines
was
common
among
wealthy
muslims
in
the
first
century
of
the
mohammadan
era
and
has
so
continued
the
famous
author
of
the
work
above
quoted
urges
the
example
of
solomon
to
prove
that
the
possession
of
numerous
concubines
is
not
inconsistent
with
piety
and
good
morals
not
considering
that
god
made
but
one
wife
for
adam

it
has
been
mentioned
in
the
first
of
the
notes
to
this
work
that
a
muslim
may
284divorce
his
wife
twice
and
each
time
take
her
back
this
he
may
do
even
against
her
wish
during
a
fixed
period
which
cannot
extend
beyond
three
months
unless
she
be
enceinte
in
which
latter
case
she
must
wait
until
the
birth
of
her
child
before
she
will
be
at
liberty
to
contract
a
new
marriage
during
this
period
the
husband
is
obliged
to
maintain
her
if
he
divorce
her
a
third
time
or
by
a
triple
sentence
he
cannot
take
her
again
unless
with
her
own
consent
and
by
a
new
contract
and
after
another
marriage
has
been
consummated
between
her
and
another
husband
and
this
husband
also
has
divorced
her

it
is
not
a
common
custom
especially
among
the
middle
ranks
for
an
arab
to
have
more
than
one
wife
at
the
same
time
but
there
are
few
of
middle
age
who
have
not
had
several
different
wives
at
different
periods
tempted
to
change
by
the
facility
of
divorce
the
case
of
alee
has
been
mentioned
above
mugheyreh
ibn-sheáºbeh
married
eighty
women
in
the
course
of
his
life301
and
several
more
remarkable
instances
of
the
love
of
change
are
recorded
by
arab
writers
the
most
extraordinary
case
of
this
kind
that
i
have
met
with
was
that
of
moáammad
ibn-eá-áeiyib
the
dyer
of
baghdÃd
who
died
in
the
year
of
the
flight
423
aged
eighty-five
years
of
whom
it
is
related
on
most
respectable
authority
that
he
married
more
than
nine
hundred
women302âsupposing
therefore
that
he
married
his
first
wife
when
he
was
fifteen
years
of
age
he
must
have
had
on
the
average
nearly
thirteen
wives
per
annum
the
women
in
general
cannot
of
course
marry
so
many
successive
husbands
not
only
because
a
woman
cannot
have
more
than
one
husband
at
a
time
but
also
because
she
cannot
divorce
her
husband
there
have
been
however
many
instances
of
arab
women
who
have
married
a
surprising
number
of
men
in
rapid
succession
among
these
may
be
mentioned
umm-khÃrijeh
who
gave
occasion
to
a
proverb
on
this
subject
this
woman
who
was
of
the
tribe
of
bejeeleh
in
el-yemen
married
upwards
of
forty
husbands
and
her
son
khÃrijeh
knew
not
who
was
his
father
she
used
to
contract
a
marriage
in
the
quickest
possible
manner
a
man
saying
to
her
khiábun
betrothal

thus
became

lawful

she
had
a
very
numerous
progeny
several
tribes
originating
from
her303

for
the
choice
of
a
wife
a
man
generally
relies
on
his
mother
or
some
other
near
female
relation
or
a
professional
female
betrother
who
is
called
khÃáibeh
for
there
are
many
women
who
perform
this
office
for
hire
the
law
allows
him
to
see
the
face
of
the
female
whom
he
proposes
to
marry
previously
to
his
making
the
contract
but
in
the
present
day
this
liberty
is
seldom
obtained
except
among
the
lower
orders
unless
in
this
case
a
man
is
not
allowed
to
see
unveiled
any
woman
but
his
own
wife
or
slave
and
those
women
to
whom
the
law
prohibits
his
uniting
himself
in
marriage
nay
according
to
some
he
is
not
allowed
to
see
his
own
niece
unveiled
though
he
may
not
marry
her
it
should
be
added
that
a
slave
may
lawfully
see
the
face
of
his
own
mistress
but
this
privilege
is
seldom
granted
in
the
present
day
to
any
slave
but
a
eunuch
an
infringement
of
the
law
above
mentioned
is
held
to
be
extremely
sinful
in
both
parties
the
curse
of
god
said
the
prophet
is
on
the
seer
and
the
seen
yet
it
is
very
often
disregarded
in
the
case
of
women
of
the
lower
orders

a
man
is
forbidden
by
the
áur-Ãn304
and
the
sunneh
to
marry
his
mother
or
other
ascendant
daughter
or
other
descendant
his
sister
or
half-sister
the
sister
of
his
father
or
mother
or
other
ascendant
his
niece
or
any
of
her
descendants
his
foster-mother
who
has
suckled
him
five
times
in
the
course
of
the
first
two
years
or
a
woman
related
to
him
by
milk
in
any
of
the
degrees
which
would
preclude
his
marriage
with
her
if
she
were
similarly
related
to
him
by
consanguinity
the
mother
of
his
wife
even
if
he
has
not
consummated
his
marriage
with
this
wife
the
daughter
of
his
wife
if
he
has
consummated
his
marriage
with
the
latter
but
if
he
has
not
done
so
and
this
wife
285is
divorced
from
him
or
dead
he
may
marry
her
daughter
his
fathers
wife
and
his
sons
wife
and
to
have
at
the
same
time
two
wives
who
are
sisters
or
aunt
and
niece
he
is
forbidden
also
to
marry
his
unemancipated
slave
or
another
mans
slave
if
he
has
already
a
free
wife
and
to
marry
any
woman
but
one
of
his
own
faith
or
a
christian
or
a
jewess
a
mohammadan
woman
however
may
only
marry
a
man
of
her
own
faith
an
unlawful
intercourse
with
any
woman
prevents
a
man
from
marrying
any
of
her
relations
who
would
be
forbidden
to
him
if
she
were
his
wife

the
reader
has
already
seen
that
a
cousin
the
daughter
of
a
paternal
uncle
is
often
chosen
as
a
wife
on
account
of
the
tie
of
blood
which
is
likely
to
attach
her
more
strongly
to
her
husband
or
on
account
of
an
affection
conceived
in
early
years
parity
of
rank
is
generally
much
regarded
and
a
man
is
often
unable
to
obtain
as
his
wife
the
daughter
of
one
of
a
different
profession
or
trade
unless
an
inferior
or
a
younger
daughter
when
an
elder
remains
unmarried
a
girl
is
often
married
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
and
sometimes
at
ten
or
even
nine
the
usual
period
is
between
twelve
and
sixteen
years
at
the
age
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
she
may
be
a
mother
the
young
men
marry
a
few
years
later

the
most
important
requisite
in
a
wife
is
religion
the
prophet
said
a
virtuous
wife
is
better
than
the
world
and
all
that
it
contains
a
virtuous
wife
said
luámÃn
is
like
a
crown
on
the
head
of
a
king
and
a
wicked
wife
is
like
a
heavy
burden
on
the
back
of
an
old
man
among
the
other
chief
requisites
are
agreeableness
of
temper
and
beauty
of
form
undiminished
by
any
defect
or
irregularity
of
features
or
members
moderation
in
the
amount
of
dowry
required
and
good
birth
it
is
said
if
thou
marry
not
a
virgin
which
is
most
desirable
marry
a
divorced
woman
and
not
a
widow
for
the
divorced
woman
will
respect
thy
words
when
thou
sayest
if
there
were
any
good
in
thee
thou
hadst
not
been
divorced
whereas
the
widow
will
say
may
god
have
mercy
on
such
a
one
he
hath
left
me
to
one
unsuited
to
me
but
according
to
another
selfish
maxim
the
woman
most
to
be
avoided
is
she
who
is
divorced
from
a
man
by
whom
she
has
had
a
child
for
her
heart
is
with
him
and
she
is
an
enemy
to
the
man
who
marries
her
after305âmodesty
is
a
requisite
upon
which
too
much
stress
cannot
be
laid
but
this
to
an
english
reader
requires
some
explanation
alee
asked
his
wife
fÃáimeh
who
is
the
best
of
women
she
answered
she
who
sees
not
men
and
whom
they
see
not306
modesty
therefore
in
the
opinion
of
the
muslims
is
most
eminently
shown
by
a
womans
concealing
her
person
and
restraining
her
eyes
from
men
the
best
rank
of
men
in
a
mosque
said
the
prophet
is
the
front
and
the
best
rank
of
women
is
the
rear307
that
is
those
most
distant
from
the
men
but
better
than
even
these
are
the
women
who
pray
at
home308âfruitfulness
is
also
a
desirable
qualification
to
be
considered
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
it
may
be
known
in
maidens
says
the
prophet
from
their
relations
because
generally
speaking
kindred
are
similar
in
disposition
c309
lastly
contentment
is
to
be
enumerated
among
the
requisites
it
is
said
on
the
same
authority
verily
the
best
of
women
are
those
that
are
most
content
with
little310
to
obtain
a
contented
and
submissive
wife
many
men
make
their
selection
from
among
the
classes
inferior
to
them
in
rank
others
with
a
similar
view
prefer
a
concubine
slave
in
the
place
of
a
wife

the
consent
of
a
girl
not
arrived
at
the
age
of
puberty
is
not
required

father
or
if
he
is
dead

as
her
wekeel
or
deputy
to
effect
the
marriage-contract
for
her
if
of
age
she
appoints
her
own
deputy
a
dowry
is
required
to
legalize
the
marriage
and
the
least
dowry
allowed
by
the
law
is
ten
dirhems
or
drachms
of
silver
about
five
shillings
of
our
money
moáammad

certain
of
his
wives
for
a
dowry
of

leather
stuffed
with
the
fibres
of

which
are
called

but
some
he
married
for
a
dowry
of
five
hundred
dirhems311
with
the
increase
of
wealth
and
luxury
dowries
have
increased
in
amount
but
to
our
ideas
they
are
still
trifling
a
sum
equivalent
to
about
twenty
pounds
sterling
being
a
common
dowry
among
arabs
of
the
middle
classes
for
a
virgin
and
half
or
a
third
or
quarter
of
that
sum
for
a
divorced
woman
or
a
widow
two-thirds
of
the
sum
is
usually
paid
before
making
the
contract
and
the
remaining
portion
held
in
reserve
to
be
paid
to
the
woman
in
case
of
her
divorce
or
in
case
of
the
husbands
death
the
father
or
guardian
of
a
girl
under
age
receives
the
former
portion
of
her
dowry
but
it
is
considered
as
her
property
and
he
generally
expends
it
with
an
additional
sum
from
his
own
purse
in
the
purchase
of
necessary
furniture
dress
c
for
her
which
the
husband
can
never
take
from
her
against
her
own
wish

the
marriage-contract
is
generally
in
the
present
day
merely
verbal
but
sometimes
a
certificate
is
written
and
sealed
by
the
áÃáee
the
most
approved
or
propitious
period
for
this
act
is
the
month
of
showwÃl
the
most
unpropitious
moáarram
the
only
persons
whose
presence
is
required
to
perform
it
are
the
bridegroom
or
his
deputy
the
brides

who
is
the
betrother
two
male
witnesses
if
such
can
be
easily
procured
and
the
áÃáee
or
a
schoolmaster
or
some
other
person
to
recite
a
khuábeh
which
consists
of
a
few
words
in
praise
of
god
a
form
of
blessing
on
the
prophet
and
some
passages
of
the
áur-Ãn
respecting
marriage
they
all
recite
the
fÃtáah
or
opening
chapter
of
the
áur-Ãn
after
which
the
bridegroom
pays
the
money
the
latter
and
the

then
seat
themselves
on
the
ground
face
to
face
and
grasp
each
others
right
hand
raising
the
thumbs
and
pressing
them
against
each
other
previously
to
the
khuábeh
the
person
who
recites
this
formula
places
a
handkerchief
over
the
two
joined
hands
and
after
the
khuábeh
he
dictates
to
the
two
contracting
parties
what
they
are
to
say
the
betrother
generally
uses
the
following
or
a
similar
form
of
words
i
betroth
to
thee
my
daughter
or
her
for
whom
i
act
as
deputy
such
a
one
naming
the
bride
the
virgin
or
the
adult
virgin
c
for
a
dowry
of
such
an
amount
the
bridegroom
answers
i
accept
from
thee
her
betrothal
to
myself
this
is
all
that
is
absolutely
necessary
but
the
address
and
reply
are
usually
repeated
a
second
and
third
time
and
are
often
expressed
in
fuller
forms
of
words
the
contract
is
concluded
with
the
recital
of
the
fÃtáah
by
all
persons
present

this
betrothal
or
marriage-contract
is
often
performed
several
years
before
the
consummation
when
the
two
parties
are
yet
children
or
during
the
infancy
of
the
girl
but
generally
not
more
than
about
eight
or
ten
days
before
the
former
event
the
household
furniture
and
dress
prepared
for
the
bride
are
sent
by
her
family
to
the
bridegrooms
house
usually
conveyed
by
a
train
of
camels
two
or
three
or
more
days
before
she
is
conducted
thither

the
feasts
and
processions
which
are
now
to
be
mentioned
are
only
observed
in
the
case
of
a
virgin
bride
a
widow
or
divorced
woman
being
remarried
in
a
private
manner
i
describe
them
chiefly
in
accordance
with
the
usages
of
cairo
which
appear
to
me
most
agreeable
in
general
with
the
descriptions
and
allusions
in
the
present
workâthe
period
most
commonly
approved
for
the
consummation
of
marriage
is
the
eve
of
friday
or
that
of
monday
previously
to
this
event
the
bridegroom
once
or
twice
or
more
frequently
gives
a
feast
to
his
friends
and
for
several
nights
his
house
and
the
houses
of
his
near
neighbours
are
usually
illuminated
by
numerous
clusters
of
lamps
or
by
lanterns
suspended
in
front
of
them
some
to
cords
drawn
across
the
street
to
these
or
other
cords
are
also
suspended
small
flags
or
square
pieces
of
silk
each
of
two
different
colours
generally
red
and
green
some
say
that
the
feast
or
feasts
should
be
given
on
the
occasion
of
the
contract
others
on
the
consummation
others
again
on
both
these
occasions312
the
usual
custom
of
the
people
of
cairo
is
to
give
a
feast
on
287the
night
immediately
preceding
that
of
the
consummation
and
another
on
the
latter
night
but
some
commence
their
feasts
earlier
respecting
marriage-feasts
the
prophet
said
the
first
days
feast
is
an
incumbent
duty
and
the
second
days
a
sunneh
ordinance
and
the
third
days
for
ostentation
and
notoriety
and
he
forbade
eating
at
the
feast
of
the
ostentatious313
it
is
a
positive
duty
to
accept
an
invitation
to
a
marriage-feast
or
other
lawful
entertainment
but
the
guest
is
not
obliged
to
eat314
the
persons
invited
and
all
intimate
friends
generally
send
presents
of
provisions
of
some
kind
a
day
or
two
before
the
prophet
taught
that
marriage-feasts
should
be
frugal
the
best
that
he
gave
was
with
one
goat315
he
approved
of
demonstrations
of
joy
at
the
celebration
of
a
marriage
with
songs
and
according
to
one
tradition
by
the
beating
of
deffs
or
tambourines
but
in
another
tradition
the
latter
practice
is
condemned316
the
preferable
mode
of
entertaining
the
guests
is
by
the
performance
of
a
zikr

the
bride

conducted
to

the
afternoon
immediately

is
conducted
thither
she
goes
to
the
public
bath
accompanied
by
a
number
of

the
procession
generally
pursues
a
circuitous
route
for
the
sake
of
greater
display
and
on
leaving
the
house
turns
to

is
completely
veiled

ride
upon
high-saddled
asses

wash
her
feet
in
a
clean
vessel
and
sprinkle
the
water
in
the
corners
of
the
chamber

a
blessing
may
result

should
also
brighten
her

apparel

adorn
her
eyes
with
koál

stain
her

procession
of
this
kind
in
which
there
were
upwards
of
seventy
parties
of
different
trades
and
arts
each
party
in
a
separate
waggon
besides
buffoons
wrestlers
dancers
and
others
followed
by
various
officers
the
eunuchs
of
the
brides
family
ladies
of
the
áareem
with
their
attendants
then
the
bride
in
a
european
carriage
a
troop
of
memlooks
clad
in
armour
and
a
turkish
band
of
music
it
was
a
procession
of
which
the
like
had
not
before
been
seen318

the
bride
and
her
party
having
arrived
at
the
house
sit
down
to
a
repast
the
bridegroom
does
not
yet
see
her
he
has
already
been
to
the
bath
and
at
nightfall
he
goes
in
procession
with
a
number
of
his
friends
to
a
mosque
to
perform
the
night-prayers
he
is
accompanied
by
musicians
and
singers
or
by
chanters
of
lyric
odes
in
praise
of
the
prophet
and
by
men
bearing
cressets
poles
with
cylindrical
frames
of
iron
at
the
top
filled
with
flaming
wood
and
on
his
return
most
of
his
other
attendants
bear
lighted
wax
candles
and
bunches
of
flowers

returned
to
his
house
he
leaves
his
friends
in
a
lower
apartment
and
goes
up
to
the
bride
whom
he
finds
seated
with
a
shawl
thrown
over
her
head
so
as
to
conceal
her
face
completely
and
attended
by
one
or
two
females
the
latter
he
induces
to
retire
by
means
of
a
small
present
he
then
gives
a
present
of
money
to
the
bride
as
the
price
of
uncovering
the
face
and
having
removed
the
covering
saying
as
he
does
so
in
the
name
of
god
the
compassionate
the
merciful
he
beholds
her
generally
for
the
first
time
on
the
occasion
of
this
first
visit
which
is
called
the
dukhool
or
dukhleh
he
is
recommended
to
perfume
himself
and
to
sprinkle
some
sugar
and
almonds
on
the
head
of
the
bride
and
on
that
of
each
woman
with
her
this
practice
being
established
by
existing
usage
and
by
traditions
also
when
he
approaches
her
he
should
perform
the
prayers
of
two
rekahs
and
she
should
do
the
same
if
able
then
he
should
take
hold
of
the
hair
over
her
forehead
and
say
o
god
bless
me
in
my
wife
and
bless
my
wife
in
me
o
god
bestow
upon
me
offspring
by
her
and
bestow

o

unite
us
as
thou
hast
united
happily
and
separate

to

the
evil
eye
some
remarks
on
the
evil
eye
have
been
made
in
a
former
note
no
24
in
the
present
series
with
respect
to
children
and
the
means
of
counteracting
its
supposed
influence
but
i
mention
this
subject
again
partly
with
the
289view
of
suggesting
to
the
reader
the
necessity
of
bearing
it
in
mind
as
it
explains
many
usages
described
or
alluded
to
in
this
work
which
would
otherwise
appear
unaccountable
he
may
remember
a
well-known
line
of
virgilâ

nescio
quis
teneros
oculus
mihi
fascinat
agnos
which
like
many
other
allusions
in
works
of
ancient
authors
shews
how
long
and
how
extensively
this
superstition
has
been
entertained
how
deeply
it
is
rooted
in
the
minds
of
arabs
even
the
most
religious
and
learned
may
be
inferred
from
this
saying
of
their
prophet
the
eye
has
a
complete
influence
because
verily
if
there
were
a
thing
to
overcome
fate
it
most
certainly
would
be
a
malignant
eye320
hence
he
permitted
charms
which
he
disallowed
in
almost
every
other
case
to
be
employed
for
the
purpose
of
counteracting
its
influence321
the
following
observation
selected
from
several
of
a
similar
nature
in
my
work
on
the
modern
egyptians
aptly
illustrates
the
passage
to
which
this
note
immediately
refers
it
is
a
custom
among
the
higher
and
middle
classes
in
cairo
on
the
occasion
of
a
marriage
to
hang
chandeliers
in
the
street
before
the
bridegrooms
house
and
it
often
happens
that
a
crowd
is
collected
to
see
a
very
large
and
handsome
chandelier
suspended
in
this
case
it
is
a
common
practice
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
spectators
by
throwing
down
and
breaking
a
large
jar
or
by
some
other
artifice
lest
an
envious
eye
should
cause
the
chandelier
to
fall

the
closet
here
alluded
to
being
one
in
which
ablution
is
performed

epithet
unlucky
is
often
applied
to

it

used

aboo-shihÃb
literally
father
of
a
shooting
star
is
a
nickname
often
given
to
a
devil
and
is
so
employed
because
devils
or
evil
jinnees
are
sometimes
destroyed
by
shooting
stars
hurled
at
them
by
angels
an
instance
of
which
occurs
in
the
tale
under
consideration

in

edition
and
in
the
calcutta
edition
of
the
first
two
hundred
nights

51âon
adoption
the
mohammadan
law
allows
the
adoption
of
sons
provided
that
the
person
to
be
adopted
consents
to
the
act
if
of
age
to
judge
for
himself
also
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
parents
by
death
or
other
means
and
that
there
be
such
a
difference
of
age
between
the
two
parties
as
might
subsist
between
a
natural
father
and
his
son
the
adopted
son
enjoys
the
same
right
of
inheritance
as
the
natural
son
but
the
adoptive
father
is
not
prevented
by
this
act
from
marrying
any
relation
of
his
adopted
son

note
52
in
the
houses
of
arabs
of
the
more
wealthy
classes
there
is
usually
a
chair
upon
which
the
turban
is
placed
at
night
it
is
of
a
large
size
but
slight
make
the
bottom
and
back
being
generally
of
cane-work
and
sometimes
it
has
a
kind
of
canopy
constructed
over
it
the
turban
when
placed
upon
it
is
covered
with
a
kerchief
of
thick
silk
stuff
often
embroidered

53
mÃáilee
may
be
understood
as
meaning
either
of
the
fashion
of
el-mÃáil
or
of
muslin
but
the
former
according
to
my
sheykh
is
the
signification
here
intended
i
think
there
is
nothing
peculiar
in
the
common
modern
turban
of
el-mÃáil

note
54
this
is
done
under
the
idea
that
it
strengthens
the
infants
eyes

note
55
ajeeb
signifies
wonderful

note
56
the
meaning
of
this

that
he

other
children
in
a
month
and
in
a
month
as
others

fifteen
the
age
of
ajeeb
has
been
shewn
to
have
been
little
more
than
eleven

therefore
i
have
substituted
twelve
for
fifteen
in

i
have
made
a

this
alludes
to
a
custom

dress
or
some
article
of
clothing
to
a

62
the
term
boy
is
not
used
here
to
imply
that
the
eunuch
was
a
youth

in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
often
employed
by
us
as
synonymous
with
servant

er-reydÃneeyeh

the

generally
halted
in
the
original
by
errors
in

diacritical
points
this
name
is
converted
into
ez-zebedÃneeyeh

note
64
the
word
which
i
translate
a
cross
literally
signifies
an
effigy
but
i
suppose
this
term
to
be
employed
merely
because
a
cross
bears
a
rude
resemblance
to
a
man
with
extended
arms

the

omitted

it

afterwards
in
the
75th

in

the
preceding
verses

some
slight
variations
are
repeated

note
68âon
the
expiation
of
oaths
the
law
clearly
allows
expiation
for
an
inconsiderate
oath
and
according
to
vulgar
opinion
for
the
violation
of
a
deliberate
oath322
the
expiation
consists
in
once
feeding
or
clothing
ten
poor
men
liberating
a
muslim
slave
or
captive
or
fasting
three
days
an
unintentional
oath
requires
no
expiation
but
the
swearing
to
a
falsehood
can
only
be
expiated
by
deep
repentance

thirty-second

the
story
of
the
humpback

there
was
in
ancient
times
in
the
city
of
el-baárah1
a
tailor
who
enjoyed
an
ample
income
and
was
fond
of
sport
and
merriment
he
was
in
the
habit
of
going
out
occasionally
with
his
wife
that
they
might
amuse
themselves
with
strange
and
diverting
scenes
and
one
day
they
went
forth
in
the
afternoon2
and
returning
home
in
the
evening
met
a
humpbacked
man
whose
aspect
was
such
as
to
excite
laughter
in
the
angry
and
to
dispel
anxiety
and
grief
so
they
approached
him
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
gazing
at
him
and
invited
him
to
return
with
them
to
their
house
and
to
join
with
them
in
a
carousal
that
night

he
assented
to
their
proposal
and
after
he
had
gone
with
them292
to
the
house
the
tailor
went
out
to
the
market
night
having
then
approached
he
bought
some
dried
fish
and
bread
and
limes
and
sweetmeat
and
returning
with
them
placed
the
fish
before
the
humpback
and
they
sat
down
to
eat
and
the
tailors
wife
took
a
large
piece
of
fish
and
crammed
the
humpback
with
it
and
closing
his
mouth
with
her
hand
said
by
allah
thou
shalt
not
swallow
it
but
by
gulping
it
at
once
and
i
will
not
give
thee
time
to
chew
it
he
therefore
swallowed
it
but
it
contained
a
large
and
sharp
bone
which
stuck
across
in
his
throat
his
destiny
having
so
determined
and
he
expired
the
tailor
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
alas
that
this
poor
creature
should
not
have
died
but
in
this
manner
by
our
handsâwherefore
this
idling
exclaimed
the
womanâand
what
can
i
do
asked
her
husbandâarise
she
answered
and
take
him
in
thy
bosom
and
cover
him
with
a
silk
napkin
i
will
go
out
first
and
do
thou
follow
me
this
very
night
and
say
this
is
my
son
and
this
is
his
mother
and
we
are
going
to
convey
him
to
the
physician
that
he
may
give
him
some
medicine

no
sooner
had
the
tailor
heard
these
words
than
he
arose
and
took
the
humpback
in
his
bosom
his
wife
accompanying
him
exclaimed
o
my
child
may
allah
preserve
thee
where
is
the
part
in
which
thou
feelest
pain
and
where
hath
this
small-pox
attacked
theeâso
every
one
who
saw
them
said
they
are
conveying
a
child
smitten
with
the
small-pox
thus
they
proceeded
inquiring
as
they
went
for
the
abode
of
the
physician
and
the
people
directed
them
to
the
house
of
a
physician
who
was
a
jew
and
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
there
came
down
to
them
a
black
slave-girl
who
opened
the
door
and
beheld
a
man
carrying
as
she
imagined
a
child
and
attended
by
its
mother
and
she
said
what
is
your
businessâwe
have
a
child
here
answered
the
tailors
wife
and
we
want
the
physician
to
see
him
take
then
this
quarter
of
a
piece
of
gold
and
give
it
to
thy
master
and
let
him
come
down
and
see
my
son
for
he
is
ill
the
girl
therefore
went
up
and
the
tailors
wife
entering
the
vestibule
said
to
her
husband
leave
the
humpback
here
and
let
us
take
ourselves
away
and
the
tailor
accordingly
set
him
up
against
the
wall
and
went
out
with
his
wife

the
slave-girl
meanwhile
went
in
to
the
jew
and
said
to
him
below
in
the
house
is
a
sick
person
with
a
woman
and
a
man
and
they
have
given
me
a
quarter
of
a
piece
of
gold
for
thee
that
thou
mayest
prescribe
for
them
what
may
suit
his
case
and
when
the293
jew
saw
the
quarter
of
a
piece
of
gold
he
rejoiced
and
rising
in
haste
went
down
in
the
dark
and
in
doing
so
his
foot
struck
against
the
lifeless
humpback
o
ezra
he
exclaimedâo
heavens
and
the
ten
commandments
o
aaron
and
joshua
son
of
nun
it
seemeth
that
i
have
stumbled
against
this
sick
person
and
he
hath
fallen
down
the
stairs
and
died
and
how
shall
i
go
forth
with
one
killed
from
my
house
o
ezras
ass3âhe
then
raised
him
and
took
him
up
from
the
court
of
the
house
to
his
wife
and
acquainted
her
with
the
accidentâand
why
sittest
thou
here
idle
said
she
for
if
thou
remain
thus
until
daybreak
our
lives
will
be
lost
let
me
and
thee
then
take
him
up
to
the
terrace
and
throw
him
into
the
house
of
our
neighbour
the
muslim
for
he
is
the
steward
of
the
suláÃns
kitchen
and
often
do
the
cats
come
to
his
house
and
eat
of
the
food
which
they
find
there4
as
do
the
mice
too
and
if
he
remain
there
for
a
night
the
dogs
will
come
down
to
him
from
the
terraces
and
eat
him
up
entirely5
so
the
jew
and
his
wife
went
up
carrying
the
humpback
and
let
him
down
by
his
hands
and
feet
to
the
pavement
placing
him
against
the
wall
which
having
done
they
descended

not
long
had
the
humpback
been
thus
deposited
when
the
steward
returned
to
his
house
and
opened
the
door
and
going
up
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
found
a
son
of
adam
standing
in
the
corner
next
the
kitchen
upon
which
he
exclaimed
what
is
this
by
allah
the
thief
that
hath
stolen
our
goods
is
none
other
than
a
son
of
adam
who
taketh
what
he
findeth
of
flesh
or
grease
even
though
i
keep
it
concealed
from
the
cats
and
the
dogs
and
if
i
killed
all
the
cats
and
dogs
of
the
quarter
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
he
cometh
down
from
the
terracesâand
so
saying
he
took
up
a
great
mallet
and
struck
him
with
it
and
then
drawing
close
to
him
gave
him
a
second
blow
with
it
upon
the
chest
when
the
humpback
fell
down
and
he
found
that
he
was
dead
whereupon
he
grieved
and
said
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
and
he
feared
for
himself
and
exclaimed
curse
upon
the
grease
and
the
flesh
and
upon
this
night
in
which
the
destiny
of
this
man
hath
been
accomplished
by
my
hand
then
looking
upon
him
and
perceiving
that
he
was
a
humpback
he
said
is
it
not
enough
that
thou
art
humpbacked
but
must
thou
also
be
a
robber
and
steal
the
flesh
and
the
grease
o
protector
cover
me
with
thy
gracious
shelterâand
he
lifted
him
upon
his
shoulders
and
descended
and
went
forth
from
his
house
towards
the
close
of
the
night
and
stopped
not
until
he
had
conveyed
him
to
the
commencement
of
the
market-street
where
he
placed
him294
upon
his
feet
by
the
side
of
a
shop
at
the
entrance
of
a
lane
and
there
left
him
and
retired

soon
after
there
came
a
christian
the
suláÃns
broker
who
in
a
state
of
intoxication
had
come
forth
to
visit
the
bath
and
he
advanced
staggering
until
he
drew
near
to
the
humpback
when
he
turned
his
eyes
and
beheld
one
standing
by
him
now
some
persons
had
snatched
off
his
turban
early
in
the
night6
and
when
he
saw
the
humpback
standing
there
he
concluded
that
he
intended
to
do
the
same
so
he
clenched
his
fist
and
struck
him
on
the
neck
down
fell
the
humpback
upon
the
ground
and
the
christian
called
out
to
the
watchman
of
the
market7
while
still
in
the
excess
of
his
intoxication
he
continued
beating
the
humpback
and
attempting
to
throttle
him
as
he
was
thus
employed
the
watchman
came
and
finding
the
christian
kneeling
upon
the
muslim8
and
beating
him
said
arise
and
quit
him
he
arose
therefore
and
the
watchman
approaching
the
humpback
saw
that
he
was
dead
and
exclaimed
how
is
it
that
the
christian
dareth
to
kill
the
muslim
then
seizing
the
christian
he
bound
his
hands
behind
him
and
took
him
to
the
house
of
the
wÃlee9
the
christian
saying
within
himself
o
heavens
o
virgin
how
have
i
killed
this
man
and
how
quickly
did
he
die
from
a
blow
of
the
handâintoxication
had
departed
and
reflection
had
come

the
humpback
and
the
christian
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
the
house
of
the
wÃlee
and
the
wÃlee
ordered
the
executioner
to
proclaim
the
christians
crime
and
he
set
up
a
gallows
and
stationed
him
beneath
it
the
executioner
then
came
and
threw
the
rope
round
his
neck
and
was
about
to
hang
him
when
the
suláÃns
steward
pushed
through
the
crowd
seeing
the
christian
standing
beneath
the
gallows
and
the
people
made
way
for
him
and
he
said
to
the
executioner
do
it
not
for
it
was
i
who
killed
himâwherefore
didst
thou
kill
him
said
the
wÃlee
he
answered
i
went
into
my
house
last
night
and
saw
that
he
had
descended
from
the
terrace
and
stolen
my
goods
so
i
struck
him
with
a
mallet
upon
his
chest
and
he
died
and
i
carried
him
out
and
conveyed
him
to
the
market-street
where
i
set
him
up
in
such
a
place
at
the
entrance
of
such
a
lane
is
it
not
enough
for
me
to
have
killed
a
muslim
that
a
christian
should
be
killed
on
my
account
hang
then
none
but
meâthe
wÃlee
therefore
when
he
heard
these
words
liberated
the
christian
broker
and
said
to
the
executioner
hang
this
man
on
the
ground
of
his
confession
and
he
took
off
the
rope
from
the
neck
of
the
christian
and295
put
it
round
the
neck
of
the
steward
and
having
stationed
him
beneath
the
gallows
was
about
to
hang
him
when
the
jewish
physician
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
called
out
to
the
executioner
saying
to
him
do
it
not
for
none
killed
him
but
i
and
the
case
was
this
he
came
to
my
house
to
be
cured
of
a
disease
and
as
i
descended
to
him
i
struck
against
him
with
my
foot
and
he
died
kill
not
the
steward
therefore
but
kill
me
so
the
wÃlee
gave
orders
to
hang
the
jewish
physician
and
the
executioner
took
off
the
rope
from
the
stewards
neck
and
put
it
round
the
neck
of
the
jew
but
lo
the
tailor
came
and
forcing
his
way
among
the
people
said
to
the
executioner
do
it
not
for
none
killed
him
but
i
and
it
happened
thus
i
was
out
amusing
myself
during
the
day
and
as
i
was
returning
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
i
met
this
humpback
in
a
state
of
intoxication
with
a
tambourine
and
singing
merrily
and
i
stopped
to
divert
myself
by
looking
at
him
and
took
him
to
my
house
i
then
bought
some
fish
and
we
sat
down
to
eat
and
my
wife
took
a
piece
of
fish
and
a
morsel
of
bread
and
crammed
them
into
his
mouth
and
he
was
choked
and
instantly
died
then
i
and
my
wife
took
him
to
the
house
of
the
jew
and
the
girl
came
down
and
opened
the
door
and
while
she
went
up
to
her
master
i
set
up
the
humpback
by
the
stairs
and
went
away
with
my
wife
so
when
the
jew
came
down
and
stumbled
against
him
he
thought
that
he
had
killed
himâand
he
said
to
the
jew
is
this
true
he
answered
yes
the
tailor
then
looking
towards
the
wÃlee
said
to
him
liberate
the
jew
and
hang
me
and
when
the
wÃlee
heard
this
he
was
astonished
at
the
case
of
the
humpback
and
said
verily
this
is
an
event
that
should
be
recorded
in
books
and
he
said
to
the
executioner
liberate
the
jew
and
hang
the
tailor
on
account
of
his
own
confession
so
the
executioner
led
him
forward
saying
dost
thou
put
forward
this
and
take
back
that
and
shall
we
not
hang
one
and
he
put
the
rope
round
the
neck
of
the
tailor

now
the
humpback
was
the
suláÃns
buffoon
and
the
suláÃn
could
not
bear
him
to
be
out
of
his
sight
and
when
the
humpback
had
got
drunk
and
been
absent
that
night
and
the
next
day
until
noon
the
king
inquired
respecting
him
of
some
of
his
attendants
and
they
answered
him
o
our
lord
the
wÃlee
hath
taken
him
forth
dead
and
gave
orders
to
hang
the
person
who
killed
him
and
there
came
a
second
and
a
third
person
each
saying
none
killed
him
but
iâand
describing
to
the
wÃlee
the
cause
of
his
killing
him
when
the
king
therefore
heard
this
he
called
out
to
the
chamberlain
and
said
to
him296
go
down
to
the
wÃlee
and
bring
them
all
hither
before
me
so
the
chamberlain
went
down
and
found
that
the
executioner
had
almost
put
to
death
the
tailor
and
he
called
out
to
him
saying
do
it
notâand
informed
the
wÃlee
that
the
case
had
been
reported
to
the
king
and
he
took
him
and
the
humpback
borne
with
him
and
the
tailor
and
the
jew
and
the
christian
and
the
steward
and
went
up
with
them
all
to
the
king
and
when
the
wÃlee
came
into
the
presence
of
the
king
he
kissed
the
ground
and
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
and
the
king
was
astonished
and
was
moved
with
merriment
at
hearing
this
tale
and
he
commanded
that
it
should
be
written
in
letters
of
gold
he
then
said
to
those
who
were
present
have
ye
ever
heard
anything
like
the
story
of
this
humpback
and
upon
this
the
christian
advanced
and
said
o
king
of
the
age
if
thou
permit
me
i
will
relate
to
thee
an
event
that
hath
occurred
to
me
more
wonderful
and
strange
and
exciting
than
the
story
of
the
humpbackâtell
us
then
thy
story
said
the
king
and
the
christian
related
as

bÃb
en-nasr
from
a
sketch
by
mr
ew
lane
c
the
story
told
by
the
christian
broker

know
o
king
of
the
age
that
i
came
to
this
country
with
merchandise
and
destiny
stayed
me
among
your
people
i
was
born
in
cairo
and
am
one
of
its
copts
and
there
i
was
brought
up
my
father
was
a
broker
and
when
i
had
attained
to
manhood
he
died
and
i
succeeded
to
his
business
and
as
i
was
sitting
one
day
lo
a
young
man
of
most
handsome
aspect
and
clad
in
a
dress
of
the
richest
description
came
to
me
riding
upon
an
ass
and
when
he
saw
me
saluted
me
whereupon
i
rose
to
him
to
pay
him
honour
and
he
produced
a
handkerchief
containing
some
sesame
and
said
what
is
the
value
of
an
ardebb10
of
this
i
answered
him
a
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
he
said
to
me
take
the
carriers
and
the
measurers
and
repair
to
the
khÃn
of
el-jÃwalee11
in
the
district
of
bÃb
en-naár12
there
wilt
thou
find
me
and
he
left
me
and
went
his
way
after
having
given
me
the
handkerchief
with
the
sample
of
the
sesame
so
i
went
about
to
the
purchasers
and
the
price
of
each
ardebb
amounted
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
pieces
of
silver
and
i
took
with
me
four
carriers
and
went
to
him
i
found
him
waiting
my
arrival
and
when
he
saw
me
he
rose
and
opened
a
magazine
and
we
measured
its
contents
and
the
whole
amounted
to
fifty
ardebbs
the
young
man
then
said
thou
shalt
have
for
every
ardebb
ten
pieces
of
silver
as
brokerage
and
do
thou
receive
the
price
and
keep
it
in
thy
care
the
whole
sum
will
be
five
thousand
and
thy
share
of
it
five
hundred
so
there
will
remain
for
me
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
and
when
i
shall
have
finished
the
sale
of
the
goods
contained
in
my
store-rooms
i
will298
come
to
thee
and
receive
it
i
replied
it
shall
be
as
thou
desirest
and
i
kissed
his
hand
and
left
him
thus
there
accrued
to
me
on
that
day
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver
besides
my
brokerage13

he
was
absent
from
me
a
month
at
the
expiration
of
which
he
came
and
said
to
me
where
is
the
money
i
answered
here
it
is
ready
and
he
said
keep
it
until
i
come
to
thee
to
receive
it
and
i
remained
expecting
him
but
he
was
absent
from
me
another
month
after
which
he
came
again
and
said
where
is
the
money
whereupon
i
arose
and
saluted
him
and
said
to
him
wilt
thou
eat
something
with
us
he
however
declined
and
said
keep
the
money
until
i
shall
have
gone
and
returned
to
receive
it
from
thee
he
then
departed
and
i
arose
and
prepared
for
him
the
money
and
sat
expecting
him
but
again
he
absented
himself
from
me
for
a
month
and
then
came
and
said
after
this
day
i
will
receive
it
from
thee
and
he
departed
and
i
made
ready
the
money
for
him
as
before
and
sat
waiting
his
return
again
however
he
remained
a
month
absent
from
me
and
i
said
within
myself
verily
this
young
man
is
endowed
with
consummate
liberality
after
the
month
he
came
attired
in
rich
clothing
and
resembling
the
full
moon
appearing
as
if
he
had
just
come
out
of
the
bath
with
red
cheek
and
fair
forehead
and
a
mole
like
a
globule
of
ambergris
when
i
beheld
him
i
kissed
his
hand
and
invoked
a
blessing
upon
him
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
wilt
thou
not
take
thy
moneyâhave
patience
with
me
he
answered
until
i
shall
have
transacted
all
my
affairs
after
which
i
will
receive
it
from
thee
and
so
saying
he
departed
and
i
said
within
myself
by
allah
when
he
cometh
i
will
entertain
him
as
a
guest
on
account
of
the
profit
which
i
have
derived
from
his
money
for
great
wealth
hath
accrued
to
me
from
it

at
the
close
of
the
year
he
returned
clad
in
a
dress
richer
than
the
former
and
i
swore
to
him
that
he
should
alight
to
be
my
guestâon
the
condition
he
replied
that
thou
expend
nothing
of
my
money
that
is
in
thy
possession
i
said
wellâand
having
seated
him
prepared
what
was
requisite
of
meats
and
drinks
and
other
provisions
and
placed
them
before
him
saying
in
the
name
of
allah
and
he
drew
near
to
the
table
and
put
forth
his
left
hand
and
thus
ate
with
me
so
i
was
surprised
at
him14
and
when
we
had
finished
he
washed
his
hand
and
i
gave
him
a
napkin
with
which
to
wipe
it
we
then
sat
down
to
converse
and
i
said
o
my
master
dispel
a
trouble
from
my
mind
wherefore
didst
thou
eat
with
thy
left
hand
probably
something
paineth
thee
in
thy
right
handâon
hearing299
these
words
he
stretched
forth
his
arm
from
his
sleeve15
and
behold
it
was
maimedâan
arm
without
a
hand
and
i
wondered
at
this
but
he
said
to
me
wonder
not
nor
say
in
thy
heart
that
i
ate
with
thee
with
my
left
hand
from
a
motive
of
self-conceit
for
rather
to
be
wondered
at
is
the
cause
of
the
cutting
off
of
my
right
hand
and
what
said
i
was
the
cause
of
it
he
answered
thusâ

know
that
i
am
from
baghdÃd
my
father
was
one
of
the
chief
people
of
that
city
and
when
i
had
attained
the
age
of
manhood
i
heard
the
wanderers
and
travellers
and
merchants
conversing
respecting
the
land
of
egypt
and
their
words
remained
in
my
heart
until
my
father
died
when
i
took
large
sums
of
money
and
prepared
merchandise
consisting
of
the
stuffs
of
baghdÃd
and
of
el-mÃáil
and
similar
precious
goods
and
having
packed
them
up
journeyed
from
baghdÃd
and
god
decreed
me
safety
until
i
entered
this
your
city
and
so
saying
he
wept
and
repeated
these
versesâ

the
blear-eyed
escapeth
a
pit
into
which
the
clear-sighted
falleth
and
the
ignorant
an
expression
by
which
the
shrewd
sage
is
ruined
the
believer
can
scarce
earn
his
food
while
the
impious
infidel
is
favoured
what
art
or
act
can
a
man
devise
it
is
what
the
almighty
appointeth
i
entered
cairo
continued
the
young
man
and
deposited
the
stuffs
in
the
khÃn
of
mesroor16
and
having
unbound
my
packages
and
put
them
in
the
magazines
gave
to
the
servant
some
money
to
buy
for
us
something
to
eat
after
which
i
slept
a
little
and
when
i
arose
i
went
to
beyn
el-áaáreyn17
i
then
returned
and
passed
the
night
and
in
the
morning
following
i
opened
a
bale
of
stuff
and
said
within
myself
i
will
arise
and
go
through
some
of
the
market-streets
and
see
the
state
of
the
mart
so
i
took
some
stuff
and
made
some
of
my
servants
carry
it
and
proceeded
until
i
arrived
at
the
áeysÃreeyeh
of
jahÃrkas18
where
the
brokers
came
to
me
having
heard
of
my
arrival
and
took
from
me
the
stuff
and
cried
it
about
for
sale
but
the
price
bidden
amounted
not
to
the
prime
cost
and
upon
this
the
sheykh
of
the
brokers
said
to
me
o
my
master
i
know
a
plan
by
which
thou
mayest
profit
and
it
is
this
that
thou
do
as
other
merchants
and
sell
thy
merchandise
upon
credit
for
a
certain
period
employing
a
scrivener
and
a
witness
and
a
money-changer
and
receive
a
portion
of
the
profits
every
thursday
and
monday
so
shalt
thou
make
of
every
piece
of
silver
two
and
besides
that
thou
wilt
be
able
to
enjoy
the
amusements
afforded
by
egypt
and
its
nileâthe
advice
is
judicious
i
replied
and
accordingly
i
took
the
brokers
with
me
to
the
khÃn
and
they
conveyed
the
stuffs
to
the
áeysÃreeyeh
where
i
sold
it
to
the
merchants
writing
a
bond
in
their
names
which
i
committed
to300
the
money-changer
and
taking
from
him
a
corresponding
bond
i
then
returned
to
the
khÃn
and
remained
there
some
days
and
every
day
i
took
for
my
breakfast
a
cup
of
wine
and
had
mutton
and
sweetmeats
prepared
for
me
until
the
month
in
which
i
became
entitled
to
the
receipt
of
the
profits
when
i
seated
myself
every
thursday
and
monday
at
the
shops
of
the
merchants
and
the
money-changer
went
with
the
scrivener
and
brought
me
the
money

money-changer
and
scrivener
c
thus
did
i
until
one
day
i
went
to
the
bath
and
returned
to
the
khÃn
and
entering
my
lodging
took
for
my
breakfast
a
cup
of
wine
and
then
slept
and
when
i
awoke
i
ate
a
fowl19
and
perfumed
myself
with
essence
and
repaired
to
the
shop
of
a
merchant
named
bedr-ed-deen
the
gardener20
who
when
he
saw
me
welcomed
me
and
conversed
with
me
a
while
in
his
shop
and
as
we
were
thus
engaged
lo
a
female
came
and
seated
herself
by
my
side
she
wore
a
headkerchief
inclined
on
one
side
and
the
odours
of
sweet
perfumes
were
diffused
from
her
and
she
captivated
my
reason
by
her
beauty
and
loveliness
as
she
raised
her
izÃr
and
i
beheld
her
black
eyes
she
saluted
bedr-ed-deen
and
he
returned
her
salutation
and
stood
conversing
with
her
and
when
i
heard
her
speech
love
for
her
took
entire
possession
of
my
heart
she
then
said
to
bedr-ed-deen
hast
thou
a
piece
of
stuff
woven
with
pure
gold
thread
and
he
produced
to
her
a
piece
and
she
said
may
i
take
it
and
go
and
then
send
thee
the
price
but
he
answered
it
is
impossible
o
my
mistress
for
this
is
the
owner
of
the
stuff
and
i
owe
him
a
portion
of
the
profitâwo
to
thee
said
she
it
is
my
custom
to
take
of
thee
each
piece
of
stuff
for
a
considerable
sum
of
money
giving
thee
a
gain
beyond
thy
wish
and
then
to
send
thee
the
priceâyes
he
rejoined
but
i
am
in
absolute301
want
of
the
price
this
day
and
upon
this
she
took
the
piece
and
threw
it
back
to
him
upon
his
breast
saying
verily
your
class
knows
not
how
to
respect
any
persons
rank
and
she
arose
and
turned
away
i
felt
then
as
if
my
soul
went
with
her
and
rising
upon
my
feet
i
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
kindly
bestow
a
look
upon
me
and
retrace
thine
honoured
steps
and
she
returned
and
smiled
and
said
for
thy
sake
i
return
and
she
sat
opposite
me
upon
the
seat
of
the
shop
and
i
said
to
bedr-ed-deen
what
is
the
price
that
thou
hast
agreed
to
give
for
this
piece
he
answered
eleven
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
i
said
to
him
thy
profit
shall
be
a
hundred
pieces
of
silver
give
me
then
a
paper
and
i
will
write
for
thee
the
price
upon
it
i
then
took
the
piece
of
stuff
from
him
and
wrote
him
the
paper
with
my
own
hand
and
gave
the
piece
of
stuff
to
the
lady
saying
to
her
take
it
and
go
and
if
thou
wilt
bring
the
price
to
me
in
the
market
or
if
thou
wilt
it
shall
be
my
present
to
thee
she
replied
god
recompense
thee
and
bless
thee
with
my
property
and
make
thee
my
husband
and
may
god
accept
this
prayerâo
my
mistress
said
i
let
this
piece
of
stuff
be
thine
and
another
like
it
and
permit
me
to
see
thy
face
and
upon
this
she
raised
her
veil
and
when
i
beheld
her
face
the
sight
drew
from
me
a
thousand
sighs
and
my
heart
was
entangled
by
her
love
so
that
i
no
longer
remained
master
of
my
reason
she
then
lowered
the
veil
again
and
took
the
piece
of
stuff
saying
o
my
master
leave
me
not
desolate
so
she
departed
while
i
continued
sitting
in
the
market-street
until
past
the
hour
of
afternoon-prayer
with
wandering
mind
overpowered
by
love
in
the
excess
of
my
passion
before
i
rose
i
asked
the
merchant
respecting
her
and
he
answered
me
she
is
a
rich
lady
the
daughter
of
a
deceased
emeer
who
left
her
great
property

i
then
took
leave
of
him
and
returned
to
the
khÃn
and
the
supper
was
placed
before
me
but
reflecting
upon
her
i
could
eat
nothing
i
laid
myself
down
to
rest
but
sleep
came
not
to
me
and
i
remained
awake
until
the
morning
when
i
arose
and
put
on
a
suit
of
clothing
different
from
that
which
i
had
worn
the
day
before
and
having
drunk
a
cup
of
wine
and
eaten
a
few
morsels
as
my
breakfast
repaired
again
to
the
shop
of
the
merchant
and
saluted
him
and
sat
down
with
him
the
lady
soon
came
wearing
a
dress
more
rich
than
the
former
and
attended
by
a
slave-girl
and
she
seated
herself
and
saluted
me
instead
of
bedr-ed-deen
and
said
with
an
eloquent
tongue
which
i
had
never
heard
surpassed
in
softness
or
sweetness
send
with
me
some
one
to
receive
the
twelve
hundred
pieces
of
silver
the
price302
of
the
piece
of
stuffâwherefore
said
i
this
haste
she
replied
may
we
never
lose
thee
and
she
handed
to
me
the
price
and
i
sat
conversing
with
her
and
made
a
sign
to
her
which
she
understood
intimating
my
wish
to
visit
her
whereupon
she
rose
in
haste
expressing
displeasure
at
my
hint
my
heart
clung
to
her
and
i
followed
in
the
direction
of
her
steps
through
the
market-street
and
lo
a
slave-girl
came
to
me
and
said
o
my
master
answer
the
summons
of
my
mistress
wondering
at
this
i
said
no
one
here
knoweth
meâhow
soon
she
rejoined
hast
thou
forgotten
her
my
mistress
is
she
who
was
to-day
at
the
shop
of
the
merchant
bedr-ed-deenâso
i
went
with
her
until
we
arrived
at
the
money-changers21
and
when
her
mistress
who
was
there
beheld
me
she
drew
me
to
her
side
and
said
o
my
beloved
thou
hast
wounded
my
heart
and
love
of
thee
hath
taken
possession
of
it
and
from
the
time
that
i
first
saw
thee
neither
sleep
nor
food
nor
drink
hath
been
pleasant
to
me
i
replied
and
more
than
that
do
i
feel
and
the
state
in
which
i
am
needs
no
complaint
to
testify
itâthen
shall
i
visit
thee
o
my
beloved
she
asked
or
wilt
thou
come
to
me
for
our
marriage
must
be
a
secret22âi
am
a
stranger
i
answered
and
have
no
place
of
reception
but
the
khÃn
therefore
if
thou
wilt
kindly
permit
me
to
go
to
thine
abode
the
pleasure
will
be
perfectâwell
she
replied
but
to-night
is
the
eve
of
friday
and
let
nothing
be
done
till
to-morrow
when
after
thou
hast
joined
in
the
prayers
do
thou
mount
thine
ass
and
inquire
for
the
áabbÃneeyeh23
and
when
thou
hast
arrived
there
ask
for
the
house
called
the
áÃah24
of
barakÃt
the
naáeeb25
known
by
the
surname
of
aboo-shÃmeh
for
there
do
i
reside
and
delay
not
for
i
shall
be
anxiously
expecting
thee

on
hearing
this
i
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
we
parted
and
i
returned
to
the
khÃn
in
which
i
lodged
i
passed
the
whole
night
sleepless
and
was
scarcely
sure
that
the
daybreak
had
appeared
when
i
rose
and
changed
my
clothes
and
having
perfumed
myself
with
essences
and
sweet
scents
took
with
me
fifty
pieces
of
gold
in
a
handkerchief
and
walked
from
the
khÃn
of
mesroor
to
bÃb
zuweyleh26
where
i
mounted
an
ass
and
said
to
its
owner
go
with
me
to
the
áabbÃneeyeh
and
in
less
than
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
set
off
and
soon
he
stopped
at
a
by-street
called
darb
el-munaááiree
when
i
said
to
him
enter
the
street
and
inquire
for
the
áÃah
of
the
naáeeb
he
was
absent
but
a
little
while
and
returning
said
alightâwalk
on
before
me
said
i
to
the
áÃah
and
he
went
on
until
he
had
led
me
to
the
house
whereupon
i
said
to
him
to-morrow303
come
to
me
hither
to
convey
me
backâin
the
name
of
allah
he
replied
and
i
handed
to
him
a
quarter
of
a
piece
of
gold
and
he
took
it
and
departed
i
then
knocked
at
the
door
and
there
came
forth
to
me
two
young
virgins
in
whom
the
forms
of
womanhood
had
just
developed
themselves
resembling
two
moons
and
they
said
enter
for
our
mistress
is
expecting
thee
and
she
hath
not
slept
last
night
from
her
excessive
love
for
thee
i
entered
an
upper
saloon
with
seven
doors
around
it
were
latticed
windows
looking
upon
a
garden
in
which
were
fruits
of
every
kind
and
running
streams
and
singing
birds
it
was
plastered
with
imperial
gypsum
in
which
a
man
might
see
his
face
reflected27
its
roof
was
ornamented
with
gilding
and
surrounded
by
inscriptions
in
letters
of
gold
upon
a
ground
of
ultramarine
it
comprised
a
variety
of
beauties
and
shone
in
the
eyes
of
beholders
the
pavement
was
of
coloured
marbles
having
in
the
midst
of
it
a
fountain
with
four
snakes
of
red
gold
casting
forth
water
from
their
mouths
like
pearls
and
jewels
at
the
corners
of
the
pool28
and
it
was
furnished
with
carpets
of
coloured
silk
and
mattresses

saloon
having
entered
i
seated
myself
and
scarcely
had
i
done
so
when
the
lady
approached
me
she
wore
a
crown
set
with
pearls
and
jewels29
her
hands
and
feet
were
stained
with
áennÃ

and
her
bosom
was
ornamented
with
gold
as
soon
as
she
beheld
me
she
smiled
in
my
face
and
embraced
me
saying
is
it
true
that
thou
hast
come
to
me
or
is
this
a
dreamâi
am
thy
slave
i
answered
and
she
said
thou
art
welcome
verily
from
the
time
when
i
first
saw
thee
neither
sleep
hath
been
sweet
to
me
nor
hath
food
been
pleasantâin
such
case
have
i
been
i
repliedâand
we
sat
down
to
converse
but
i
hung
down
my
head
towards
the
ground
in
bashfulness
and304
not
long
had
i
thus
remained
when
a
repast
was
placed
before
me
consisting
of
the
most
exquisite
dishes
as
fricandoes
and
hashes
and
stuffed
fowls
i
ate
with
her
until
we
were
satisfied
when
they
brought
the
basin
and
ewer
and
i
washed
my
hands
after
which
we
perfumed
ourselves
with
rose-water
infused
with
musk
and
sat
down
again
to
converse
expressing
to
each
other
our
mutual
passion
and
her
love
took
such
possession
of
me
that
all
the
wealth
i
possessed
seemed
worthless
in
comparison
in
this
manner
we
continued
to
enjoy
ourselves
until
night
approaching
the
female
slaves
brought
supper
and
wine
a
complete
service
and
we
drank
until
midnight
never
in
my
life
had
i
passed
such
a
night
and
when
morning
came
i
arose
and
having
thrown
to
her
the
handkerchief
containing
the
pieces
of
gold30
i
took
leave
of
her
and
went
out
but
as
i
did
so
she
wept
and
said
o
my
master
when
shall
i
see
again
this
lovely
face
i
answered
her
i
will
be
with
thee
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
and
when
i
went
forth
i
found
the
owner
of
the
ass
who
had
brought
me
the
day
before
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
and
i
mounted
and
returned
with
him
to
the
khÃn
of
mesroor
where
i
alighted
and
gave
to
him
half
a
piece
of
gold
saying
to
him
come
hither
at
sunset
he
replied
on
the
head
be
thy
command

i
entered
the
khÃn
and
ate
my
breakfast
and
then
went
forth
to
collect
the
price
of
my
stuffs
after
which
i
returned
i
had
prepared
for
my
wife
a
roasted
lamb
and
purchased
some
sweetmeat
and
i
now
called
the
porter
described
to
him
the
house
and
gave
him
his
hire
having
done
this
i
occupied
myself
again
with
my
business
until
sunset
when
the
owner
of
the
ass
came
and
i
took
fifty
pieces
of
gold
and
put
them
into
a
handkerchief
entering
the
house
i
found
that
they
had
wiped
the
marble
and
polished
the
vessels
of
copper
and
brass
and
filled
the
lamps
and
lighted
the
candles
and
dished
the
supper
and
strained
the
wine
and
when
my
wife
saw
me
she
threw
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
said
thou
hast
made
me
desolate
by
thine
absence
the
tables
were
then
placed
before
us
and
we
ate
until
we
were
satisfied
and
the
slave-girls
took
away
the
first
table
and
placed
before
us
the
wine
and
we
sat
drinking
and
eating
of
the
dried
fruits
and
making
merry
until
midnight
we
then
slept
until
morning
when
i
arose
and
handed
her
the
fifty
pieces
of
gold
as
before
and
left
her

thus
i
continued
to
do
for
a
long
time
until
i
passed
the
night
and
awoke
possessing
not
a
piece
of
silver
nor
one
of
gold
and
i
said
within
myself
this
is
the
work
of
the
devil
and
i
repeated
these
verses305â

poverty
causeth
the
lustre
of
a
man
to
grow
dim
like
the
yellowness
of
the
setting
sun
when
absent
he
is
not
remembered
among
mankind
and
when
present
he
shareth
not
their
pleasures
in
the
market-streets
he
shunneth
notice
and
in
desert
places
he
poureth
forth
his
tears
by
allah
a
man
among
his
own
relations
when
afflicted
with
poverty
is
as
a
stranger
interior
of
bÃb
zuweyleh
from
a
sketch
by
m
coste
with
these
reflections
i
walked
forth
into
beyn
el-áaáreyn
and
proceeded
thence
to
bÃb
zuweyleh
where
i
found
the
people
crowding
together
so
that
the
gate
was
stopped
up
by
their
number
and
as
destiny
willed
i
saw
there
a
trooper
and
unintentionally
pressing
against
him
my
hand
came
in
contact
with
his
pocket
and
i
felt
it
and
found
that
it
contained
a
purse
and
i
caught
hold
of
the
purse
and
took
it
from
his
pocket
but
the
trooper
felt
that
his
pocket
was
lightened
and
putting
his
hand
into
it
found
nothing
upon
which
he
looked
aside
at
me
and
raised
his
hand
with
the
mace31
and
struck
me
upon
my
head
i
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
people
surrounded
us
and
seized
the
bridle
of
the
troopers
horse
saying
on
account
of
the
crowd
dost
thou
strike
this
young
man
such
a
blow
but
he
called
out
to
them
and
said
this
is
a
robber
on
hearing
this
i
feared
the
people
around
me
said
this
is
a
comely
young
man
and
hath
taken
nothing
while
some
however
believed
this
others
disbelieved
and
after
many
words
the
people
dragged
me
along
desiring
to
liberate
me
but
as
it
was
predestined
there
came
at
this
moment
the
wÃlee
and
other
magistrates
entering
the
gate
and
seeing
the
people
surrounding
me
and
the
trooper
the
wÃlee
said
what
is
the
news
the
trooper
answered
by
allah
o
emeer
this
is
a
robber
i
had
in
my
pocket
a
blue
purse
containing
twenty
pieces
of
gold
and
he
took
it
while
i
was
pressed
by
the
crowdâwas
any
one
with
thee
asked
the
wÃlee
the
trooper
answered
no
and
the
wÃlee
called
out
to
the
chief
of
his
servants
saying
seize
him
and
search
him
so
he
seized
me
and
protection
was
withdrawn
from
me
and
the
wÃlee
said
to
him
strip
him
of
all
that
is
upon
him
and
when
he
did
so
they
found
the
purse
in
my
clothes
and
the
wÃlee
taking
it
counted
the
money
and
found
it
to
be
twenty
pieces
of
gold
as
the
trooper
had
said
whereupon
he
was
enraged
and
called
out
to
his
attendants
saying
bring
him
forward
they
therefore
brought
me
before
him
and
he
said
to
me
o
young
man
tell
the
truth
didst
thou
steal
this
purseâand
i
hung
down
my
head
towards
the
ground
saying
within
myself
if
i
answer
that
i
did
not
steal
it
it
will
be
useless
for
he
hath
produced
it
from
my
clothes
and
if
i
say
i
stole306
it
i
fall
into
trouble
i
then
raised
my
head
and
said
yes
i
took
it
and
when
the
wÃlee
heard
these
words
he
wondered
and
called
witnesses
who
presented
themselves
and
gave
their
testimony
to
my
confessionâall
this
took
place
at
bÃb
zuweylehâthe
wÃlee
then
ordered
the
executioner
to
cut
off
my
hand
and
he
cut
off
my
right
hand32
but
the
heart
of
the
trooper
was
moved
with
compassion
for
me
and
he
interceded
for
me
that
i
should
not
be
killed33
so
the
wÃlee
left
me
and
departed
the
people
however
continued
around
me
and
gave
me
to
drink
a
cup
of
wine
and
the
trooper
gave
me
the
purse
saying
thou
art
a
comely
youth
and
it
is
not
fit
that
thou
shouldst
be
a
thief
and
i
took
it
from
him
and
addressed
him
with
these
versesâ

by
allah
good
sir
i
was
not
a
robber
nor
was
i
a
thief
o
best
of
mankind
but
fortunes
vicissitudes
overthrew
me
suddenly
and
anxiety
and
trouble
and
poverty
overpowered
me
i
cast
it
not
but
it
was
the
deity
who
cast
an
arrow
that
threw
down
the
kingly
diadem
from
my
head34
307
the
trooper
then
left
me
and
departed
after
having
given
me
the
purse
and
i
went
my
way
but
first
i
wrapped
my
hand
in
a
piece
of
rag35
and
put
it
in
my
bosom
my
condition
thus
altered
and
my
countenance
pallid
in
consequence
of
my
sufferings
i
walked
to
the
áÃah
and
in
a
disordered
state
of
mind
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
my
wife
seeing
my
complexion
thus
changed
said
to
me
what
hath
pained
thee
and
wherefore
do
i
see
thee
thus
altered
i
answered
her
my
head
acheth
and
i
am
not
well
and
on
hearing
this
she
was
vexed
and
became
ill
on
my
account
and
said
burn
not
my
heart
o
my
master
sit
up
and
raise
thy
head
and
tell
me
what
hath
happened
to
thee
this
day
for
i
read
a
tale
in
thy
faceâabstain
from
speaking
to
me
i
replied
and
she
wept
and
said
it
seemeth
that
thou
art
tired
of
us
for
i
see
thee
to
be
conducting
thyself
in
a
manner
contrary
to
thy
usual
habit
then
she
wept
again
and
continued
addressing
me
though
i
made
her
no
reply
until
the
approach
of
night
when
she
placed
some
food
before
me
but
i
abstained
from
it
fearing
that
she
should
see
me
eat
with
my
left
hand
and
said
i
have
no
desire
to
eat
at
present
she
then
said
again
tell
me
what
hath
happened
to
thee
this
day
and
wherefore
i
see
thee
anxious
and
broken-hearted
i
answered
i
will
presently
tell
thee
at
my
leisure
and
she
put
the
wine
towards
me
saying
take
it
for
it
will
dispel
thine
anxiety
and
thou
must
drink
and
tell
me
thy
story
i
replied
therefore
if
it
must
be
so
give
me
to
drink
with
thy
hand
and
she
filled
a
cup
and
drank
it
and
then
filled
it
again
and
handed
it
to
me
and
i
took
it
from
her
with
my
left
hand
and
while
tears
ran
from
my
eyes
i
repeated
these
versesâ

when
god
willeth
an
event
to
befall
a
man
who
is
endowed
with
reason
and
hearing
and
sight
he
deafeneth
his
ears
and
blindeth
his
heart
and
draweth
his
reason
from
him
as
a
hair36
till
having
fulfilled
his
purpose
against
him
he
restoreth
him
his
reason
that
he
may
be
admonished37
having
thus
said
i
wept
again
and
when
she
saw
me
do
so
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
said
what
is
the
reason
of
thy
weeping
thou
hast
burned
my
heart
and
wherefore
didst
thou
take
the
cup
with
thy
left
handâi
answered
her
i
have
a
boil
upon
my
right
handâthen
put
it
forth
said
she
that
i
may
open
it
for
theeâit
is
not
yet
i
replied
the
proper
time
for
opening
it
and
continue
not
to
ask
me
for
i
will
not
put
it
forth
at
present
i
then
drank
the
contents
of
the
cup
and
she
continued
to
hand
me
the
wine
until
intoxi308cation
overcame
me
and
i
fell
asleep
in
the
place
where
i
was
sitting
upon
which
she
discovered
that
my
right
arm
was
without
a
hand
and
searching
me
saw
the
purse
containing
the
gold

grief
such
as
none
else
experienceth
overcame
her
at
the
sight
and
she
suffered
incessant
torment
on
my
account
until
the
morning
when
i
awoke
and
found
that
she
had
prepared
for
me
a
dish
composed
of
four
boiled
fowls
which
she
placed
before
me
she
then
gave
me
to
drink
a
cup
of
wine
and
i
ate
and
drank
and
put
down
the
purse
and
was
about
to
depart
but
she
said
whither
wouldst
thou
go
i
answered
to
such
a
place
to
dispel
somewhat
of
the
anxiety
which
oppresseth
my
heartâgo
not
said
she
but
rather
sit
down
again
so
i
sat
down
and
she
said
to
me
hath
thy
love
of
me
become
so
excessive
that
thou
hast
expended
all
thy
wealth
upon
me
and
lost
thy
hand
i
take
thee
then
as
witness
against
me
and
god
also
is
witness
that
i
will
never
desert
thee
and
thou
shalt
see
the
truth
of
my
wordsâimmediately
therefore
she
sent
for
witnesses
who
came
and
she
said
to
them
write
my
contract
of
marriage
to
this
young
man
and
bear
witness
that
i
have
received
the
dowry
and
they
did
as
she
desired
them
after
which
she
said
bear
witness
that
all
my
property
which
is
in
this
chest
and
all
my
memlooks
and
female
slaves
belong
to
this
young
man
accordingly
they
declared
themselves
witnesses
of
her
declaration
and
i
accepted
the
property
and
they
departed
after
they
had
received
their
fees
she
then
took
me
by
my
hand
and
having
led
me
to
a
closet
opened
a
large
chest
and
said
to
me
see
what
is
contained
in
this
chest
i
looked
therefore
and
lo
it
was
full
of
handkerchiefs
and
she
said
this
is
thy
property
which
i
have
received
from
thee
for
every
time
that
thou
gavest
me
a
handkerchief
containing
fifty
pieces
of
gold
i
wrapped
it
up
and
threw
it
into
this
chest
take
then
thy
property
for
god
hath
restored
it
to
thee
and
thou
art
now
of
high
estate
fate
hath
afflicted
thee
on
my
account
so
that
thou
hast
lost
thy
right
hand
and
i
am
unable
to
compensate
thee
if
i
should
sacrifice
my
life
it
would
be
but
a
small
thing
and
thy
generosity
would
still
have
surpassed
mineâshe
then
added
now
take
possession
of
thy
property
so
i
received
it
and
she
transferred
the
contents
of
her
chest
to
mine
adding
her
property
to
mine
which
i
had
given
her
my
heart
rejoiced
my
anxiety
ceased
and
i
approached
and
kissed
her
and
made
myself
merry
by
drinking
with
her
after
which
she
said
again
thou
hast
sacrificed
all
thy
wealth
and
thy
hand
through
love
of
me
and
how
can
i
compensate
thee
by
allah
if
i
gave
my
life
for
love
of
thee309
it
were
but
a
small
thing
and
i
should
not
do
justice
to
thy
claims
upon
meâshe
then
wrote
a
deed
of
gift
transferring
to
me
all
her
apparel
and
her
ornaments
of
gold
and
jewels
and
her
houses
and
other
possessions
and
she
passed
that
night
in
grief
on
my
account
having
heard
my
relation
of
the
accident
that
had
befallen
me

thus
we
remained
less
than
a
month
during
which
time
she
became
more
and
more
infirm
and
disordered
and
she
endured
no
more
than
fifty
days
before
she
was
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
other
world
so
i
prepared
her
funeral
and
deposited
her
body
in
the
earth
and
having
caused
recitations
of
the
áur-Ãn
to
be
performed
for
her
and
given
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
alms
for
her
sake
returned
from
the
tomb
i
found
that
she
had
possessed
abundant
wealth
and
houses
and
lands
and
among
her
property
were
the
store-rooms
of
sesame
of
which
i
sold
to
thee
the
contents
of
one
and
i
was
not
prevented
from
settling
with
thee
during
this
period
but
by
my
being
busied
in
selling
the
remainder
the
price
of
which
i
have
not
yet
entirely
received
now
i
desire
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
not
oppose
me
in
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
to
thee
since
i
have
eaten
of
thy
food
i
give
thee
the
price
of
the
sesame
which
is
in
thy
handsâthis
which
i
have
told
thee
was
the
cause
of
my
eating
with
my
left
hand

i
replied
thou
hast
treated
me
with
kindness
and
generosityâand
he
then
said
thou
must
travel
with
me
to
my
country
for
i
have
bought
merchandise
of
cairo
and
alexandria
wilt
thou
accompany
meâi
answered
yesâand
promised
him
that
i
would
be
ready
by
the
first
day
of
the
following
month
so
i
sold
all
that
i
possessed
and
having
bought
merchandise
with
the
produce
travelled
with
the
young
man
to
this
thy
country
where
he
sold
his
merchandise
and
bought
other
in
its
stead
after
which
he
returned
to
the
land
of
egypt
but
it
was
my
lot
to
remain
here
and
to
experience
that
which
hath
befallen
me
this
night
during
my
absence
from
my
native
countryânow
is
not
this
o
king
of
the
age
more
wonderful
than
the
story
of
the
humpback

the
king
replied
ye
must
be
hanged
all
of
youâand
upon
this
the
suláÃns
steward
advanced
towards
the
king
and
said
if
thou
permit
me
i
will
relate
to
thee
a
story
that
i
happened
to
hear
just
before
i
found
this
humpback
and
if
it
be
more
wonderful
than
the
events
relating
to
him
wilt
thou
grant
us
our
livesâthe
king
answered
tell
thy
storyâand
he
began
thus310â

head-piece
to
the
story
told
by
the
sultÃns
steward
the
story
told
by
the
suláÃns
steward

i
was
last
night
with
a
party
who
celebrated
a
recitation
of
the
áur-Ãn38
for
which
purpose
they
had
assembled
the
professors
of
religion
and
law
and
when
these
reciters
had
accomplished
their
task
the
servants
spread
a
repast
comprising
among
other
dishes
a
zirbÃjeh39
we
approached
therefore
to
eat
of
the
zirbÃjeh
but
one
of
the
company
drew
back
and
refused
to
partake
of
it
we
conjured
him
yet
he
swore
that
he
would
not
eat
of
it
and
we
pressed
him
again
but
he
said
press
me
not
for
i
have
suffered
enough
from
eating
of
this
dish
and
when
we
had
finished
we
said
to
him
by
allah
tell
us
the
reason
of
thine
abstaining
from
eating
of
this
zirbÃjeh
he
replied
because
i
cannot
eat
of
it
unless
i
wash
my
hands
forty
times
with
kali
and
forty
times
with
cyperus
and
forty
times
with
soap
altogether
a
hundred
and
twenty
times
and
upon
this
the
giver
of
the
entertainment
ordered
his
servants
and
they
brought
water
and
the
other
things
which
this
man
required
so
he
washed
his
hands
as
he
had
described
and
advanced
though
with
disgust
and
having
seated
himself
stretched
forth
his
hand
as
one
in
fear
and
put
it
into
the
zirbÃjeh
and
began
to
eat
while
we
regarded
him
with
the
utmost
wonder
his
hand
trembled
and
when
he
put
it
forth
we
saw
that
his
thumb
was
cut
off
and
that
he
ate
with
his
four
fingers
we
therefore
said
to
him
we
conjure
thee
by
allah
to
tell
us
how
was
thy
thumb
maimed
was
it
thus
created
by
god
or
hath
some
accident
happened
to
itâo
my
brothers
he
answered
not
only
have
i
lost
this
thumb
but
also
the
thumb
of
the
other
hand
and
each
of
my311
feet
is
in
like
manner
deprived
of
the
great
toe
but
see
yeâand
so
saying
he
uncovered
the
stump
of
the
thumb
of
his
other
hand
and
we
found
it
like
the
right
and
so
also
his
feet
destitute
of
the
great
toes
at
the
sight
of
this
our
wonder
increased
and
we
said
to
him
we
are
impatient
to
hear
thy
story
and
thine
account
of
the
cause
of
the
amputation
of
thy
thumbs
and
great
toes
and
the
reason
of
thy
washing
thy
hands
a
hundred
and
twenty
times
so
he
saidâ

know
that
my
father
was
a
great
merchant
the
chief
of
the
merchants
of
the
city
of
baghdÃd
in
the
time
of
the
khaleefeh
hÃroon
er-rasheed
but
he
was
ardently
addicted
to
the
drinking
of
wine
and
hearing
the
lute
and
when
he
died
he
left
nothing
i
buried
him
and
caused
recitations
of
the
áur-Ãn
to
be
performed
for
him
and
after
i
had
mourned
for
him
days
and
nights
i
opened
his
shop
and
found
that
he
had
left
in
it
but
few
goods
and
that
his
debts
were
many
however
i
induced
his
creditors
to
wait
and
calmed
their
minds
and
betook
myself
to
selling
and
buying
from
week
to
week
and
so
paying
the
creditors40

thus
i
continued
to
do
for
a
considerable
period
until
i
had
discharged
all
the
debts
and
increased
my
capital
and
as
i
was
sitting
one
day
i
beheld
a
young
lady
than
whom
my
eye
had
never
beheld
any
more
beautiful
decked
with
magnificent
ornaments
and
apparel
riding
on
a
mule
with
a
slave
before
her
and
a
slave
behind
her
and
she
stopped
the
mule
at
the
entrance
of
the
market-street
and
entered
followed
by
a
eunuch
who
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
enter
but
inform
no
one
who
thou
art
lest
thou
open
the
fire
of
indignation
upon
us
the
eunuch
then
further
cautioned
her
and
when
she
looked
at
the
shops
of
the
merchants
she
found
none
more
handsome
than
mine
so
when
she
arrived
before
me
with
the
eunuch
following
her
she
sat
down
upon
the
seat
of
my
shop
and
saluted
me
and
i
never
heard
speech
more
charming
than
hers
or
words
more
sweet
she
then
drew
aside
the
veil
from
her
face
and
i
directed
at
her
a
glance
which
drew
from
me
a
sigh
my
heart
was
captivated
by
her
love
and
i
continued
repeatedly
gazing
at
her
face
and
recited
these
two
versesâ

say
to
the
beauty
in
the
dove-coloured
veil
death
would
indeed
be
welcome
to
relieve
me
from
thy
torment
favour
me
with
a
visit
that
so
i
may
live
see
i
stretch
forth
my
hand
to
accept
thy
liberality
and
when
she
had
heard
my
recitation
of
them
she
answered
thus312â

may
i
lose
my
heart
if
it
cease
to
love
you
for
verily
my
heart
loveth
none
but
you
if
my
eye
regard
any
charms
but
yours
may
the
sight
of
you
never
rejoice
it
after
absence
she
then
said
to
me
o
youth
hast
thou
any
handsome
stuffsâo
my
mistress
i
answered
thy
slave
is
a
poor
man
but
wait
until
the
other
merchants
open
their
shops
and
then
i
will
bring
thee
what
thou
desirest
so
i
conversed
with
her
drowned
in
the
sea
of
her
love
and
bewildered
by
my
passion
for
her
until
the
merchants
had
opened
their
shops
when
i
arose
and
procured
all
that
she
wanted
and
the
price
of
these
stuffs
was
five
thousand
pieces
of
silver
and
she
handed
them
all
to
the
eunuch
who
took
them
after
which
they
both
went
out
from
the
market-street
and
the
slaves
brought
to
her
the
mule
and
she
mounted
without
telling
me
whence
she
was
and
i
was
ashamed
to
mention
the
subject
to
her
consequently
i
became
answerable
for
the
price
to
the
merchants
incurring
a
debt
of
five
thousand
pieces
of
silver

i
went
home
intoxicated
with
her
love
and
they
placed
before
me
the
supper
and
i
ate
a
morsel
but
reflections
upon
her
beauty
and
loveliness
prevented
my
eating
more
i
desired
to
sleep
but
sleep
came
not
to
me
and
in
this
condition
i
remained
for
a
week
the
merchants
demanded
of
me
their
money
but
i
prevailed
upon
them
to
wait
another
week
and
after
this
week
the
lady
came
again
riding
upon
a
mule
and
attended
by
a
eunuch
and
two
other
slaves
and
having
saluted
me
said
o
my
master
we
have
been
tardy
in
bringing
to
thee
the
price
of
the
stuffs
bring
now
the
money-changer
and
receive
it41
so
the
money-changer
came
and
the
eunuch
gave
him
the
money
and
i
took
it
and
sat
conversing
with
her
until
the
market
was
replenished
and
the
merchants
opened
their
shops
when
she
said
to
me
procure
for
me
such
and
such
things
accordingly
i
procured
for
her
what
she
desired
of
the
merchants
and
she
took
the
goods
and
departed
without
saying
anything
to
me
respecting
the
price
when
she
had
gone
therefore
i
repented
of
what
i
had
done
for
i
had
procured
for
her
what
she
demanded
for
the
price
of
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
as
soon
as
she
had
disappeared
from
my
sight
i
said
within
myself
what
kind
of
love
is
this
she
hath
brought
me
five
thousand
pieces
of
silver
and
taken
goods
for
a
thousand
pieces
of
goldâi
feared
that
the
result
would
be
my
bankruptcy
and
the
loss
of
the
property
of
others
and
said
the
merchants
know
none
but
me
and
this
woman
is
no
other
than
a
cheat
who
hath
imposed
upon
me313
by
her
beauty
and
loveliness
seeing
me
to
be
young
she
hath
laughed
at
me
and
i
asked
her
not
where
was
her
residence

arrival
of
the
lady
on
the
mule
i
remained
in
a
state
of
perplexity
and
her
absence
was
prolonged
more
than
a
month
meanwhile
the
merchants
demanded
of
me
their
money
and
so
pressed
me
that
i
offered
my
possessions
for
sale
and
was
on
the
brink
of
ruin
but
as
i
was
sitting
absorbed
in
reflection
suddenly
she
alighted
at
the
gate
of
the
market-street
and
came
in
to
me
as
soon
as
i
beheld
her
my
solicitude
ceased
and
i
forgot
the
trouble
which
i
had
suffered
she
approached
and
addressed
me
with
her
agreeable
conversation
and
said
produce
the
scales
and
weigh
thy
moneyâand
she
gave
me
the
price
of
the
goods
which
she
had
taken
with
a
surplus
after
which
she
amused
herself
by
talking
with
me
and
i
almost
died
with
joy
and
happiness
she
then
said
to
me
hast
thou
a
wife
i
answered
no
for
i
am
not
acquainted
with
any
womanâand
wept
so
she
asked
me
what
causeth
thee
to
weep
and
i
answered
a
thought
that
hath
come
into
my
mindâand
taking
some
pieces
of
gold
gave
them
to
the
eunuch
requesting
him
to
grant
me
his
mediation
in
the
affair
upon
which
he
laughed
and
said
she
is
in
love
with
thee
more
than
thou
art
with
her
and
hath
no
want
of
the
stuffs
but
hath
done
this
only
from
her
love
of
thee
propose
to
her
therefore
what
thou
wilt
for
she
will314
not
oppose
thee
in
that
which
thou
wilt
say
now
she
observed
me
giving
the
pieces
of
gold
to
the
eunuch
and
returned
and
resumed
her
seat
and
i
said
to
her
shew
favour
to
thy
slave
and
pardon
me
for
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
i
then
acquainted
her
with
the
feelings
of
my
heart
and
my
declaration
pleased
her
and
she
consented
to
my
proposal
saying
this
eunuch
will
come
with
my
letter
and
do
thou
what
he
shall
tell
theeâand
she
arose
and
departed

i
went
to
the
merchants
and
delivered
to
them
their
money
and
all
profited
except
myself
for
when
she
left
me
i
mourned
for
the
interruption
of
our
intercourse
and
i
slept
not
during
the
whole
of
the
next
night
but
a
few
days
after
her
eunuch
came
to
me
and
i
received
him
with
honour
and
asked
him
respecting
his
mistress
he
answered
she
is
sickâand
i
said
to
him
disclose
to
me
her
history
he
replied
the
lady
zubeydeh
the
wife
of
hÃroon
er-rasheed
brought
up
this
damsel
and
she
is
one
of
her
slaves
she
had
desired
of
her
mistress
to
be
allowed
the
liberty
of
going
out
and
returning
at
pleasure
and
the
latter
gave
her
permission
she
continued
therefore
to
do
so
until
she
became
a
chief
confident
after
which
she
spoke
of
thee
to
her
mistress
and
begged
that
she
would
marry
her
to
thee
but
her
mistress
said
i
will
not
do
it
until
i
see
this
young
man
and
if
he
have
a
desire
for
thee
i
will
marry
thee
to
him
we
therefore
wish
to
introduce
thee
immediately
into
the
palace
and
if
thou
enter
without
any
ones
having
knowledge
of
thy
presence
thou
wilt
succeed
in
accomplishing
thy
marriage
with
her
but
if
thy
plot
be
discovered
thy
head
will
be
struck
off
what
then
sayest
thouâi
answered
good
i
will
go
with
thee
and
await
the
event
that
shall
befall
me
thereâas
soon
then
as
this
next
night
shall
have
closed
in
said
the
eunuch
repair
to
the
mosque
which
the
lady
zubeydeh
hath
built
on
the
bank
of
the
tigris
and
there
say
thy
prayers
and
pass
the
night42âmost
willingly
i
replied

accordingly
when
the
time
of
nightfall
arrived
i
went
to
the
mosque
and
said
my
prayers
there
and
passed
the
night
and
as
soon
as
the
morning
began
to
dawn
i
saw
two
eunuchs
approaching
in
a
small
boat
conveying
some
empty
chests
which
they
brought
into
the
mosque
one
of
them
then
departed
and
the
other
remained
and
i
looked
attentively
at
him
and
lo
it
was
he
who
had
been
our
intermediary
and
soon
after
the
damsel
my
companion
came
up
to
us
i
rose
to
her
when
she
approached
and
embraced
her
and
she
kissed
me
and
wept
and
after
we
had
conversed
together
for
a
little
while
she
took
me
and
placed
me
in
a
chest
and
locked
it
upon
me43
the
slaves
then
brought
a
quantity
of
stuffs
and
filled
with
them
the
other315
chests
which
they
locked
and
conveyed
together
with
the
chest
in
which
i
was
enclosed
to
the
boat
accompanied
by
the
damsel
and
having
embarked
them
they
plied
the
oars
and
proceeded
to
the
palace
of
the
honoured
lady
zubeydeh
the
intoxication
of
love
now
ceased
in
me
and
reflection
came
in
its
place
i
repented
of
what
i
had
done
and
prayed
god
to
deliver
me
from
my
dangerous
predicament

mosque
on
the
bank
of
the
tigris
meanwhile
they
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
khaleefeh
where
they
landed
and
took
out
all
the
chests
and
conveyed
them
into
the
palace
but
the
chief
of
the
door-keepers
who
had
been
asleep
when
they
arrived
was
awoke
by
the
sounds
of
their
voices
and
cried
out
to
the
damsel
saying
the
chests
must
be
opened
that
i
may
see
what
is
in
themâand
he
arose
and
placed
his
hand
upon
the
chest
in
which
i
was
hidden
my
reason
abandoned
me
my
heart
almost
burst
from
my
body
and
my
limbs
trembled
but
the
damsel
said
these
are
the
chests
of
the
lady
zubeydeh
and
if
thou
open
them
and
turn
them
over
she
will
be
incensed
against
thee
and
we
shall
all
perish
they
contain
nothing
but
clothes
dyed
of
various
colours
except
this
chest
upon
which
thou
hast
put
thy
hand
in
which
there
are
also
some
bottles
filled
with
the
water
of
zemzem44
and
if
any
of
the
water
run
out
upon
the
clothes
it
will
spoil
their
colours
now
i
have
advised
thee
and
it
is
for
thee
to
decide
so
do
what
thou
wiltâwhen
he
heard
therefore
these
words
he
said
to
her
take
the
chests
and
pass
onâand
the
eunuchs
immediately
took
them
up
and
with
the
damsel
conveyed
them
into
the
palace
but
in
an
instant
i
heard
a
person
crying
out
and
saying
the
khaleefeh
the
khaleefeh

i
was
bereft
of
my
reason
and
seized
with
a
colick
from
excessive
fear
i
almost
died
and
my
limbs
were
affected
with
a
violent
shaking
the
khaleefeh
cried
out
to
the
damsel
saying
to
her
what
are
these
chests
she
answered
o
my
lord
may
god
exalt
thy
dominion
these
chests
contain
clothes
of
my
mistress
zubeydehâopen
them316
said
the
khaleefeh
that
i
may
see
the
clothesâwhen
i
heard
this
i
felt
sure
of
my
destruction
the
damsel
could
not
disobey
his
command
but
she
replied
o
prince
of
the
faithful
there
is
nothing
in
these
chests
but
clothes
of
the
lady
zubeydeh
and
she
hath
commanded
me
not
to
open
them
to
any
one
the
khaleefeh
however
said
the
chests
must
be
opened
all
of
them
that
i
may
see
their
contentsâand
immediately
he
called
out
to
the
eunuchs
to
bring
them
before
him
i
therefore
felt
certain
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
destruction
they
then
brought
before
him
chest
after
chest
and
opened
each
to
him
and
he
examined
the
contents
and
when
they
brought
forward
the
chest
in
which
i
was
enclosed
i
bade
adieu
to
life
and
prepared
myself
for
death
but
as
the
eunuchs
were
about
to
open
it
the
damsel
said
o
prince
of
the
faithful
verily
this
chest
containeth
things
especially
appertaining
to
women
and
it
is
proper
therefore
that
it
should
be
opened
before
the
lady
zubeydehâand
when
the
khaleefeh
heard
her
words
he
ordered
the
eunuchs
to
convey
all
the
chests
into
the
interior
of
the
palace
the
damsel
then
hastened
and
ordered
two
eunuchs
to
carry
away
the
chest
in
which
i
was
hidden
and
they
took
it
to
an
inner
chamber
and
went
their
way
whereupon
she
quickly
opened
it
and
made
a
sign
to
me
to
come
out
so
i
did
as
she
desired
and
entered
a
closet
that
was
before
me
and
she
locked
the
door
upon
me
and
closed
the
chest
and
when
the
eunuchs
had
brought
in
all
the
chests
and
had
gone
back
she
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
and
said
thou
hast
nothing
to
fear
may
god
refresh
thine
eye
come
forth
now
and
go
up
with
me
that
thou
mayest
have
the
happiness
of
kissing
the
ground
before
the
lady
zubeydeh

i
therefore
went
with
her
and
beheld
twenty
other
female
slaves
high-bosomed
virgins
and
among
them
was
the
lady
zubeydeh
who
was
scarcely
able
to
walk
from
the
weight
of
the
robes
and
ornaments
with
which
she
was
decked
as
she
approached
the
female
slaves
dispersed
from
around
her
and
i
advanced
to
her
and
kissed
the
ground
before
her
she
made
a
sign
to
me
to
sit
down
so
i
seated
myself
before
her
and
she
began
to
ask
me
questions
respecting
my
condition
and
lineage
to
all
of
which
i
gave
such
answers
that
she
was
pleased
and
said
by
allah
the
care
which
we
have
bestowed
on
the
education
of
this
damsel
hath
not
been
in
vain
she
then
said
to
me
know
that
this
damsel
is
esteemed
by
us
as
though
she
were
really
our
child
and
she
is
a
trust
committed
to
thy
care
by
god
upon
this
therefore
i
again
kissed
the
ground
before
her
well
pleased
to
marry
the
damsel
after
which
she
commanded
me
to
remain
with
them
ten
days
accordingly
i
continued
with
them
during
this317
period
but
i
knew
nothing
meanwhile
of
the
damsel
certain
of
the
maids
only
bringing
me
my
dinner
and
supper
as
my
servants
after
this
however
the
lady
zubeydeh
asked
permission
of
her
husband
the
prince
of
the
faithful
to
marry
her
maid
and
he
granted
her
request
and
ordered
that
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
should
be
given
to
her

displaying
of
the
bride
the
lady
zubeydeh
therefore
sent
for
the
áÃáee
and
witnesses
and
they
wrote
my
contract
of
marriage
to
the
damsel
and
the
maids
then
prepared
sweetmeats
and
exquisite
dishes
and
distributed
them
in
all
the
apartments
thus
they
continued
to
do
for
a
period
of
ten
more
days
and
after
the
twenty
days
had
passed
they
conducted
the
damsel
into
the
bath
preparatively
to
my
being
introduced
to
her
as
her
husband
they
then
brought
to
me
a
repast
comprising
a
basin
of
zirbÃjeh
sweetened
with
sugar
perfumed
with
rose-water
infused
with
musk
and
containing
different
kinds
of
fricandoed
fowls
and
a
variety
of
other
ingredients
such
as
astonished
the
mind
and
by
allah
when
this
repast
was
brought
i
instantly
commenced
upon
the
zirbÃjeh
and
ate
of
it
as
much
as
satisfied
me
and
wiped
my
hand
but
forgot
to
wash
it
i
remained
sitting
until
it
became
dark
when
the
maids
lighted
the
candles
and
the
singing-girls
approached
with
the
tambourines
and
they
continued
to
display
the
bride
and
to
give
presents
of
gold
until
she
had
perambulated
the
whole
of
the
palace
after
which
they
brought
her
to
me
and
disrobed
her
and
as
soon
as
i
was
left
alone
with
her
i
threw
my
arms
around
her
neck318
scarcely
believing
in
our
union
but
as
i
did
so
she
perceived
the
smell
of
the
zirbÃjeh
from
my
hand
and
immediately
uttered
a
loud
cry
whereupon
the
female
slaves
ran
in
to
her
from
every
quarter

i
was
violently
agitated
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
and
the
slaves
who
had
come
in
said
to
her
what
hath
happened
to
thee
o
our
sisterâtake
away
from
me
she
exclaimed
to
them
this
madman
whom
i
imagined
to
be
a
man
of
senseâwhat
indication
of
my
insanity
hath
appeared
to
thee
i
asked
thou
madman
said
she
wherefore
hast
thou
eaten
of
the
zirbÃjeh
and
not
washed
thy
hand
by
allah
i
will
not
accept
thee
for
thy
want
of
sense
and
thy
disgusting
conductâand
so
saying
she
took
from
her
side
a
whip45
and
beat
me
with
it
upon
my
back
until
i
became
insensible
from
the
number
of
the
stripes
she
then
said
to
the
other
maids
take
him
to
the
magistrate
of
the
city
police
that
he
may
cut
off
his
hand
with
which
he
ate
the
zirbÃjeh
without
washing
it
afterwards
on
hearing
this
i
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
wilt
thou
cut
off
my
hand
on
account
of
my
eating
a
zirbÃjeh
and
neglecting
to
wash
itâand
the
maids
who
were
present
entreated
her
saying
to
her
o
our
sister
be
not
angry
with
him
for
what
he
hath
done
this
time
but
she
replied
by
allah
i
must
cut
off
something
from
his
extremities
and
immediately
she
departed
and
was
absent
from
me
ten
days
after
which
she
came
again
and
said
to
me
o
thou
black-faced
am
i
not
worthy
of
thee
how
didst
thou
dare
to
eat
the
zirbÃjeh
and
not
wash
thy
handâand
she
called
to
the
maids
who
bound
my
hands
behind
me
and
she
took
a
sharp
razor
and
cut
off
both
my
thumbs
and
both
my
great
toes
as
ye
see
o
companions
and
i
swooned
away
she
then
sprinkled
upon
my
wounds
some
powder
by
means
of
which
the
blood
was
stanched
and
i
said
i
will
not
eat
of
a
zirbÃjeh
as
long
as
i
live
unless
i
wash
my
hands
forty
times
with
kali
and
forty
times
with
cyperus
and
forty
times
with
soapâand
she
exacted
of
me
an
oath
that
i
would
not
eat
of
this
dish
unless
i
washed
my
hands
as
i
have
described
to
you
therefore
when
this
zirbÃjeh
was
brought
my
colour
changed
and
i
said
within
myself
this
was
the
cause
of
the
cutting
off
of
my
thumbs
and
great
toesâso
when
ye
compelled
me
i
said
i
must
fulfil
the
oath
which
i
have
sworn

i
then
said
to
him
continued
the
suláÃns
steward
and
what
happened
to
thee
after
that
he
answered
when
i
had
thus
sworn
to
her
she
was
appeased
and
i
was
admitted
into
her
favour
and
we
lived
happily
together
for
a
considerable
time
after
which
she
said
the
people
of
the
khaleefehs
palace
know
not
that
thou
hast
resided319
here
with
me
and
no
strange
man
beside
thee
hath
entered
it
nor
didst
thou
enter
but
through
the
assistance
of
the
lady
zubeydeh
she
then
gave
me
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
said
to
me
take
these
pieces
of
gold
and
go
forth
and
buy
for
us
a
spacious
house
so
i
went
forth
and
purchased
a
handsome
and
spacious
house
and
removed
thither
all
the
riches
that
she
possessed
and
all
that
she
had
treasured
up
and
her
dresses
and
raritiesâthis
was
the
cause
of
the
amputation
of
my
thumbs
and
great
toesâso
we
ate
said
the
suláÃns
steward
and
departed
and
after
this
the
accident
with
the
humpback
happened
to
me
this
is
all
my
story
and
peace
be
on
thee

the
king
said
this
is
not
more
pleasant
than
the
story
of
the
humpback
nay
the
story
of
the
humpback
is
more
pleasant
than
this
and
ye
must
all
of
you
be
crucifiedâthe
jew
however
then
came
forward
and
having
kissed
the
ground
said
o
king
of
the
age
i
will
relate
to
thee
a
story
more
wonderful
than
that
of
the
humpbackâand
the
king
said
relate
thy
story
so
he
commenced
thusâ

the
most
wonderful
of
the
events
that
happened
to
me
in
my
younger
days
was
thisâi
was
residing
in
damascus
where
i
learnt
and
practised
my
art
and
while
i
was
thus
occupied
one
day
there
came
to
me
a
memlook
from
the
house
of
the
governor
of
the
city
so
i
went
forth
with
him
and
accompanied
him
to
the
abode
of
the
governor
i
entered
and
beheld
at
the
upper
end
of
a
saloon
a
couch
of
alabaster
overlaid
with
plates
of
gold
upon
which
was
reclining
a
sick
man
he
was
young
and
a
person
more
comely
had
not
been
seen
in
his
age
seating
myself
at
his
head
i
ejaculated
a
prayer
for
his
restoration46
and
he
made
a
sign
to
me
with
his
eye
i
then
said
to
him
o
my
master
stretch
forth
to
me
thy
handâwhereupon
he
put
forth
to
me
his
left
hand
and
i
was
surprised
at
this
and
said
within
myself
what
self-conceit
i
felt
his
pulse
however
and
wrote
a
prescription
for
him
and
continued
to
visit
him
for
a
period
of
ten
days
until
he
recovered
his
strength
when
he
entered
the
bath
and
washed
himself
and
came
forth
and
the
governor
conferred
upon
me
a
handsome
dress
of
honour
and
appointed
me
superintendent
of
the
hospital
of
damascus47
but
when
i
went
with
him
into
the
bath
which
they
had
cleared
of
all
other
visitors
for
us
alone
and
the
servants
had
brought
the
clothes
and
taken
away
those
which
he
had
pulled
off
within
i
perceived
that
his
right
hand
had
been
cruelly
amputated
at
the
sight
of
which
i
wondered
and
grieved
for
him
and
looking
at
his
skin
i
observed321
upon
him
marks
of
beating
with
miáraahs
which
caused
me
to
wonder
more
the
young
man
then
turned
towards
me
and
said
o
doctor
of
the
age
wonder
not
at
my
case
for
i
will
relate
to
thee
my
story
when
we
have
gone
out
from
the
bathâand
when
we
had
gone
forth
and
arrived
at
the
house
and
had
eaten
some
food
and
rested
he
said
to
me
hast
thou
a
desire
to
divert
thyself
in
the
supper-room
i
answered
yesâand
immediately
he
ordered
the
slaves
to
take
up
thither
the
furniture
and
to
roast
a
lamb
and
bring
us
some
fruit
so
the
slaves
did
as
he
commanded
them
and
when
they
had
brought
the
fruit
and
we
had
eaten
i
said
to
him
relate
to
me
thy
storyâand
he
replied
o
doctor
of
the
age
listen
to
the
relation
of
the
events
which
have
befallen
me

know
that
i
am
of
the
children
of
el-mÃáil
my
paternal
grandfather
died
leaving
ten
male
children
one
of
whom
was
my
father
he
was
the
eldest
of
them
and
they
all
grew
up
and
married
and
my
father
was
blest
with
me
but
none
of
his
nine
brothers
was
blest
with
children
so
i
grew
up
among
my
uncles
who
delighted
in
me
exceedingly
and
when
i
had
attained
to
manhood
i
was
one
day
with
my
father
in
the
chief
mosque
of
el-mÃáil
the
day
was
friday
and
we
performed
the
congregational
prayers
and
all
the
people
went
out
except
my
father
and
my
uncles
who
sat
conversing
together
respecting
the
wonders
of
various
countries
and
the
strange
sights
of
different
cities
until
they
mentioned
egypt
when
one
of
my
uncles
said
the
travellers
assert
that
there
is
not
on
the
face
of
the
earth
a
more
agreeable
country
than
egypt
with
its
nile48âand
my
father
added
he
who
hath
not
seen
cairo
hath
not
seen
the
world
its
soil
is
gold
its
nile
is
a
wonder
its
women
are
like
the
black-eyed
virgins
of
paradise
its
houses
are
palaces
and
its
air
is
temperate
its
odour
surpassing
that
of
aloes-wood
and
cheering
the
heart
and
how
can
cairo
be
otherwise
when
it
is
the
metropolis
of
the
world49
did
ye
see
its
gardens
in
the
evening
he
continued
with
the
shade
obliquely
extending
over
them
ye
would
behold
a
wonder
and
yield
with
ecstasy
to
their
attractions50

when
i
heard
these
descriptions
of
egypt
my
mind
became
wholly
engaged
by
reflections
upon
that
country
and
after
they
had
departed
to
their
homes
i
passed
the
night
sleepless
from
my
excessive
longing
towards
it
and
neither
food
nor
drink
was
pleasant
to
me
a
few
days
after
my
uncles
prepared
to
journey
thither
and
i
wept
before
my
father
that
i
might
go
with
them
so
that
he
prepared
a
stock
of
merchandise
for
me
and
i
departed
in
their
company
but
he
said
to322
them
suffer
him
not
to
enter
egypt
but
leave
him
at
damascus
that
he
may
there
sell
his
merchandise

aleppo
i
took
leave
of
my
father
and
we
set
forth
from
el-mÃáil
and
continued
our
journey
until
we
arrived
at
aleppo
where
we
remained
some
days
after
which
we
proceeded
thence
until
we
came
to
damascus
and
we
beheld
it
to
be
a
city
with
trees
and
rivers
and
fruits
and
birds
as
though
it
were
a
paradise
containing
fruits
of
every
kind
we
took
lodgings
in
one
of
the
khÃns
and
my
uncles
remained
there
until
they
had
sold
and
bought
and
they
also
sold
my
merchandise
gaining
for
every
piece
of
silver
five
so
that
i
rejoiced
at
my
profit
my
uncles
then
left
me
and
repaired
to
egypt
and
i
remained
and
took
up
my
abode
in
a
handsome
áÃah
such
as
the
tongue
cannot
describe
the
monthly
rent
of
which
was
two
pieces
of
gold51

here
i
indulged
myself
with
eating
and
drinking
squandering
away
the
money
that
was
in
my
possession
and
as
i
was
sitting
one
day
at
the
door
of
the
áÃah
a
damsel
approached
me
attired
in
clothing
of
the
richest
description
such
as
i
had
never
seen
surpassed
in
costliness
and
i
invited
her
to
come
in
whereupon
without
hesitation
she
entered
and
i
was
delighted
at
her
compliance
and
closed
the
door
upon
us
both
she
then
uncovered
her
face
and
took
off
her
izÃr
and
i
found
her
to
be
so
surprisingly
beautiful
that
love
for
her
took
possession
of
my
heart
so
i
went
and
brought
a
repast
consisting
of
the
most
delicious
viands
and
fruit
and
everything
else
that
was323
requisite
for
her
entertainment
and
we
ate
and
sported
together
after
which
we
drank
till
we
were
intoxicated
and
fell
asleep
and
so
we
remained
until
the
morning
when
i
handed
her
ten
pieces
of
gold
but
she
swore
that
she
would
not
accept
them
from
me
and
said
expect
me
again
o
my
beloved
after
three
days
at
the
hour
of
sunset
i
will
be
with
thee
and
do
thou
prepare
for
us
with
these
pieces
of
gold
a
repast
similar
to
this
which
we
have
just
enjoyed
she
then
gave
me
ten
pieces
of
gold
and
took
leave
of
me
and
departed
taking
my
reason
with
her
and
after
the
three
days
had
expired
she
came
again
decked
with
embroidered
stuffs
and
ornaments
and
other
attire
more
magnificent
than
those
which
she
wore
on
the
former
occasion
i
had
prepared
for
her
what
was
required
previously
to
her
arrival
so
we
now
ate
and
drank
and
fell
asleep
as
before
and
in
the
morning
she
gave
me
again
ten
pieces
of
gold
promising
to
return
to
me
after
three
more
days
i
therefore
made
ready
what
was
requisite
and
after
the
three
days
she
came
attired
in
a
dress
still
more
magnificent
than
the
first
and
second
and
said
to
me
o
my
master
am
i
beautifulâyea
verily
i
answeredâwilt
thou
give
me
leave
she
rejoined
to
bring
with
me
a
damsel
more
beautiful
than
myself
and
younger
than
i
that
she
may
sport
with
us
and
we
may
make
merry
with
her
for
she
hath
requested
that
she
may
accompany
me
and
pass
the
night
in
frolicking
with
usâand
so
saying
she
gave
me
twenty
pieces
of
gold
desiring
me
to
prepare
a
more
plentiful
repast
on
account
of
the
lady
who
was
to
come
with
her
after
which
she
bade
me
farewell
and
departed

accordingly
on
the
fourth
day
i
procured
what
was
requisite
as
usual
and
soon
after
sunset
she
came
accompanied
by
a
female
wrapped
in
an
izÃr
and
they
entered
and
seated
themselves
i
was
rejoiced
and
i
lighted
the
candles
and
welcomed
them
with
joy
and
exultation
they
then
took
off
their
outer
garments
and
when
the
new
damsel
uncovered
her
face
i
perceived
that
she
was
like
the
full
moon
i
had
never
beheld
a
person
more
beautiful
i
arose
immediately
and
placed
before
them
the
food
and
drink
and
we
ate
and
drank
while
i
continued
caressing
the
new
damsel
and
filling
the
wine-cup
for
her
and
drinking
with
her
but
the
first
lady
was
affected
with
a
secret
jealousyâby
allah
she
said
verily
this
girl
is
beautiful
is
she
not
more
charming
than
iâyea
indeed
i
answeredâsoon
after
this
i
fell
asleep
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
i
found
my
hand
defiled
with
blood
and
opening
my
eyes
perceived
that
the
sun
had
risen
so
i
attempted
to
rouse
the
damsel324
my
new
companion
whereupon
her
head
rolled
from
her
body
the
other
damsel
was
gone
and
i
concluded
therefore
that
she
had
done
this
from
her
jealousy
and
after
reflecting
a
while
i
arose
and
took
off
my
clothes
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
áÃah
in
which
i
deposited
the
murdered
damsel
afterwards
covering
her
remains
with
earth
and
replacing
the
marble
pavement
as
it
was
before
i
then
dressed
myself
again
and
taking
the
remainder
of
my
money
went
forth
and
repaired
to
the
owner
of
the
áÃah
and
paid
him
a
years
rent
saying
to
him
i
am
about
to
journey
to
my
uncles
in
egypt

so
i
departed
to
egypt
where
i
met
with
my
uncles
and
they
were
rejoiced
to
see
me
i
found
that
they
had
concluded
the
sale
of
their
merchandise
and
they
said
to
me
what
is
the
cause
of
thy
coming
i
answered
i
had
a
longing
desire
to
be
with
you
and
feared
that
my
money
would
not
suffice
meâfor
a
year
i
remained
with
them
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
egypt
and
its
nile
and
i
dipped
my
hand
into
the
residue
of
my
money
and
expended
it
prodigally
in
eating
and
drinking
until
near
the
time
of
my
uncles
departure
when
i
fled
from
them
so
they
said
probably
he
hath
gone
before
us
and
returned
to
damascusâand
they
departed
i
then
came
forth
from
my
concealment
and
remained
in
cairo
three
years
squandering
away
my
money
until
scarcely
any
of
it
remained
but
meanwhile
i
sent
every
year
the
rent
of
the
áÃah
at
damascus
to
its
owner
and
after
the
three
years
my
heart
became
contracted
for
nothing
remained
in
my
possession
but
the
rent
for
the
year

i
therefore
journeyed
back
to
damascus
and
alighted
at
the
áÃah
the
owner
was
rejoiced
to
see
me
and
i
entered
it
and
cleansed
it
of
the
blood
of
the
murdered
damsel
and
removing
a
cushion
i
found
beneath
this
the
necklace
that
she
had
worn
that
night
i
took
it
up
and
examined
it
and
wept
a
while
after
this
i
remained
in
the
house
two
days
and
on
the
third
day
i
entered
the
bath
and
changed
my
clothes
i
now
had
no
money
left
and
i
went
one
day
to
the
market
where
the
devil
suggesting
it
to
me
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
destiny
i
handed
the
necklace
of
jewels
to
a
broker
and
he
rose
to
me
and
seated
me
by
his
side
then
having
waited
until
the
market
was
replenished
he
took
it
and
announced
it
for
sale
secretly
without
my
knowledge
the
price
bidden
for
it
amounted
to
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
but
he
came
to
me
and
said
this
necklace
is
of
brass
of
the
counterfeit
manufacture
of
the
franks
and
its
price
hath
amounted
to
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver
i
answered
him
yes
we
had
made
it
for
a
woman
merely
to
laugh
at
her
and
my
wife325
has
inherited
it
and
we
desire
to
sell
it
go
therefore
and
receive
the
thousand
pieces
of
silver
now
when
the
broker
heard
this
he
perceived
that
the
affair
was
suspicious
and
went
and
gave
the
necklace
to
the
chief
of
the
market
who
took
it
to
the
wÃlee
and
said
to
him
this
necklace
was
stolen
from
me
and
we
have
found
the
thief
clad
in
the
dress
of
the
sons
of
the
merchants
and
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
the
officers
had
surrounded
me
and
they
took
me
to
the
wÃlee
who
questioned
me
respecting
the
necklace
i
told
him
therefore
the
same
story
that
i
had
told
to
the
broker
but
he
laughed
and
said
this
is
not
the
truthâand
instantly
his
people
stripped
me
of
my
outer
clothing
and
beat
me
with
miáraahs
all
over
my
body
until
through
the
torture
that
i
suffered
from
the
blows
i
said
i
stole
itâreflecting
that
it
was
better
i
should
say
i
stole
it
than
confess
that
its
owner
was
murdered
in
my
abode
for
then
they
would
kill
me
to
avenge
her
and
as
soon
as
i
had
said
so
they
cut
off
my
hand
and
scalded
the
stump
with
boiling
oil52
and
i
swooned
away
they
then
gave
me
to
drink
some
wine
by
swallowing
which
i
recovered
my
senses
and
i
took
my
amputated
hand
and
returned
to
the
áÃah
but
its
owner
said
to
me
since
this
hath
happened
to
thee
leave
the
áÃah
and
look
for
another
abode
for
thou
art
accused
of
an
unlawful
actâo
my
master
i
replied
give
me
two
or
three
days
delay
that
i
may
seek
for
a
lodgingâand
he
assented
to
this
and
departed
and
left
me
so
i
remained
alone
and
sat
weeping
and
saying
how
can
i
return
to
my
family
with
my
hand
cut
off
he
who
cut
it
off
knoweth
not
that
i
am
innocent
perhaps
then
god
will
bring
about
some
event
for
my
relief

the
arrest
i
sat
weeping
violently
and
when
the
owner
of
the
áÃah
had326
departed
from
me
excessive
grief
overcame
me
and
i
was
sick
for
two
days
and
on
the
third
day
suddenly
the
owner
of
the
áÃah
came
to
me
with
some
officers
of
the
police
and
the
chief
of
the
market
and
accused
me
again
of
stealing
the
necklace
so
i
went
out
to
them
and
said
what
is
the
newsâwhereupon
without
granting
me
a
moments
delay
they
bound
my
arms
behind
me
and
put
a
chain
around
my
neck
saying
to
me
the
necklace
which
was
in
thy
possession
hath
proved
to
be
the
property
of
the
governor
of
damascus
its
wezeer
and
its
ruler
it
hath
been
lost
from
the
governors
house
for
a
period
of
three
years
and
with
it
was
his
daughterâwhen
i
heard
these
words
from
them
my
limbs
trembled
and
i
said
within
myself
they
will
kill
me
my
death
is
inevitable
by
allah
i
must
relate
my
story
to
the
governor
and
if
he
please
he
will
kill
me
or
if
he
please
he
will
pardon
meâand
when
we
arrived
at
the
governors
abode
and
they
had
placed
me
before
him
and
he
beheld
me
he
said
is
this
he
who
stole
the
necklace
and
went
out
to
sell
it
verily
ye
have
cut
off
his
hand
wrongfullyâhe
then
ordered
that
the
chief
of
the
market
should
be
imprisoned
and
said
to
him
give
to
this
person
the
compensatory
fine
for
his
hand53
or
i
will
hang
thee
and
seize
all
thy
property
and
he
called
out
to
his
attendants
who
took
him
and
dragged
him
away

i
was
now
left
with
the
governor
alone
after
they
had
by
his
permission
loosed
the
chain
from
my
neck
and
untied
the
cords
which
bound
my
arms
and
the
governor
looking
towards
me
said
to
me
o
my
son
tell
me
thy
story
and
speak
truth
how
did
this
necklace
come
into
thy
possessionâso
i
replied
o
my
lord
i
will
tell
thee
the
truthâand
i
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
to
me
with
the
first
damsel
and
how
she
had
brought
to
me
the
second
and
murdered
her
from
jealousy
on
hearing
which
he
shook
his
head
and
covered
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
wept
then
looking
towards
me
he
said
know
o
my
son
that
the
elder
damsel
was
my
daughter
i
kept
her
closely
and
when
she
had
attained
a
fit
age
for
marriage
i
sent
her
to
the
son
of
her
uncle
in
cairo
but
he
died
and
she
returned
to
me
having
learnt
habits
of
profligacy
from
the
inhabitants
of
that
city54
so
she
visited
thee
four
times
and
on
the
fourth
occasion
she
brought
to
thee
her
younger
sister
they
were
sisters
by
the
same
mother
and
much
attached
to
each
other
and
when
the
event
which
thou
hast
related
occurred
to
the
elder
she
imparted
her
secret
to
her
sister
who
asked
my
permission
to
go
out
with
her
after
which
the
elder
returned
alone
and
when
i
questioned
her
re327specting
her
sister
i
found
her
weeping
for
her
and
she
answered
i
know
no
tidings
of
herâbut
she
afterwards
informed
her
mother
secretly
of
the
murder
which
she
had
committed
and
her
mother
privately
related
the
affair
to
me
and
she
continued
to
weep
for
her
incessantly
saying
by
allah
i
will
not
cease
to
weep
for
her
until
i
die
thy
account
o
my
son
is
true
for
i
knew
the
affair
before
thou
toldest
it
me
see
then
o
my
son
what
hath
happened
and
now
i
request
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
not
oppose
me
in
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
and
it
is
thisâi
desire
to
marry
thee
to
my
youngest
daughter
for
she
is
not
of
the
same
mother
as
they
were55
she
is
a
virgin
and
i
will
receive
from
thee
no
dowry
but
will
assign
to
you
both
an
allowance
and
thou
shalt
be
to
me
as
an
own
sonâi
replied
let
it
be
as
thou
desirest
o
my
master
how
could
i
expect
to
attain
unto
such
happinessâthe
governor
then
sent
immediately
a
courier
to
bring
the
property
which
my
father
had
left
me
for
he
had
died
since
my
departure
from
him
and
now
i
am
living
in
the
utmost
affluence

i
wondered
said
the
jew
at
his
history
and
after
i
had
remained
with
him
three
days
he
gave
me
a
large
sum
of
money
and
i
left
him
to
set
forth
on
a
journey
and
arriving
in
this
your
country
my
residence
here
pleased
me
and
i
experienced
this
which
hath
happened
to
me
with
the
humpback

the
king
when
he
had
heard
this
story
said
this
is
not
more
wonderful
than
the
story
of
the
humpback
and
ye
must
all
of
you
be
hanged
and
especially
the
tailor
who
is
the
source
of
all
the
mischief
but
he
afterwards
added
o
tailor
if
thou
tell
me
a
story
more
wonderful
than
that
of
the
humpback
i
will
forgive
you
your
offences
so
the
tailor
advanced
and
saidâ

the
story
told
by
the
tailor

know
o
king
of
the
age
that
what
hath
happened
to
me
is
more
wonderful
than
the
events
which
have
happened
to
all
the
others
before
i
met
the
humpback
i
was
early
in
the
morning
at
an
entertainment
given
to
certain
tradesmen
of
my
acquaintance
consisting
of
tailors
and
linen-drapers
and
carpenters
and
others
and
when
the
sun
had
risen
the
repast
was
brought
for
us
to
eat
and
lo
the
master
of
the
house
came
in
to
us
accompanied
by
a
strange
and
handsome
young
man
of
the
inhabitants
of
baghdÃd
he
was
attired
in
clothes
of
the
handsomest
description
and
was
a
most
comely
person
except
that
he
was
lame
and
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
and
saluted
us
we
rose
to
him
but
when
he
was
about
to
seat
himself
he
observed
among
us
a
man
who
was
a
barber
whereupon
he
refused
to
sit
down
and
desired
to
depart
from
us
we
and
the
master
of
the
house
however
prevented
him
and
urged
him
to
seat
himself
and
the
host
conjured
him
saying
what
is
the
reason
of
thy
entering
and
then
immediately
departingâby
allah
o
my
master
replied
he
offer
me
no
opposition
for
the
cause
of
my
departure
is
this
barber
who
is
sitting
with
you
and
when
the
host
heard
this
he
was
exceedingly
surprised
and
said
how
is
it
that
the
heart
of
this
young
man
who
is
from
baghdÃd
is
troubled
by
the
presence
of
this
barber
we329
then
looked
towards
him
and
said
relate
to
us
the
cause
of
thy
displeasure
against
this
barber
and
the
young
man
replied
o
company
a
surprising
adventure
happened
to
me
with
this
barber
in
baghdÃd
my
city
and
he
was
the
cause
of
my
lameness
and
of
the
breaking
of
my
leg
and
i
have
sworn
that
i
will
not
sit
in
any
place
where
he
is
present
nor
dwell
in
any
town
where
he
resides
i
quitted
baghdÃd
and
took
up
my
abode
in
this
city
and
i
will
not
pass
the
next
night
without
departing
from
itâupon
this
we
said
to
him
we
conjure
thee
by
allah
to
relate
to
us
thy
adventure
with
himâand
the
countenance
of
the
barber
turned
pale
when
he
heard
us
make
this
request
the
young
man
then
saidâ

know
o
good
people
that
my
father
was
one
of
the
chief
merchants
of
baghdÃd
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
blessed
him
with
no
son
but
myself
and
when
i
grew
up
and
had
attained
to
manhood
my
father
was
admitted
to
the
mercy
of
god
leaving
me
wealth
and
servants
and
other
dependants
whereupon
i
began
to
attire
myself
in
clothes
of
the
handsomest
description
and
to
feed
upon
the
most
delicious
meats
now
god
whose
perfection
be
extolled
made
me
to
be
a
hater
of
women
and
so
i
continued
until
one
day
i
was
walking
through
the
streets
of
baghdÃd
when
a
party
of
them
stopped
my
way
i
therefore
fled
from
them
and
entering
a
by-street
which
was
not
a
thoroughfare
i
reclined
upon
a
maááabah
at
its
further
extremity
here
i
had
been
seated
but
a
short
time
when
lo
a
window
opposite
the
place
where
i
sat
was
opened
and
there
looked
out
from
it
a
damsel
like
the
full
moon
such
as
i
had
never
in
my
life
beheld
she
had
some
flowers
which
she
was
watering
beneath
the
window
and
she
looked
to
the
right
and
left
and
then
shut
the
window
and
disappeared
from
before
me
fire
had
been
shot
into
my
heart
and
my
mind
was
absorbed
by
her
my
hatred
of
women
was
turned
into
love
and
i
continued
sitting
in
the
same
place
until
sunset
in
a
state
of
distraction
from
the
violence
of
my
passion
when
lo
the
áÃáee
of
the
city
came
riding
along
with
slaves
before
him
and
servants
behind
him
and
alighted
and
entered
the
house
from
which
the
damsel
had
looked
out
so
i
knew
that
he
must
be
her
father

i
then
returned
to
my
house
sorrowful
and
fell
upon
my
bed
full
of
anxious
thoughts
and
my
female
slaves
came
in
to
me
and
seated
themselves
around
me
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
with
me
and
i
acquainted
them
not
with
my
case
nor
returned
any
answers
to
their
questions
and
my
disorder
increased
the
neigh330bours
therefore
came
to
cheer
me
with
their
visits
and
among
those
who
visited
me
was
an
old
woman
who
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
discovered
my
state
whereupon
she
seated
herself
at
my
head
and
addressing
me
in
a
kind
manner
said
o
my
son
tell
me
what
hath
happened
to
thee
so
i
related
to
her
my
story
and
she
said
o
my
son
this
is
the
daughter
of
the
áÃáee
of
baghdÃd
and
she
is
kept
in
close
confinement
the
place
where
thou
sawest
her
is
her
apartment
and
her
father
occupies
a
large
saloon
below
leaving
her
alone
and
often
do
i
visit
her
thou
canst
obtain
an
interview
with
her
only
through
me
so
brace
up
thy
nerves
when
i
heard
therefore
what
she
said
i
took
courage
and
fortified
my
heart
and
my
family
rejoiced
that
day
i
rose
up
firm
in
limb
and
hoping
for
complete
restoration
and
the
old
woman
departed
but
she
returned
with
her
countenance
changed
and
said
o
my
son
ask
not
what
she
did
when
i
told
her
of
thy
case
for
she
said
if
thou
abstain
not
o
ill-omened
old
woman
from
this
discourse
i
will
treat
thee
as
thou
deservestâbut
i
must
go
to
her
a
second
time

increased
after
some
days
however
the
old
woman
came
again
and
said
o
my
son
i
desire
of
thee
a
reward
for
good
tidings
my
soul
returned
to
my
body
at
these
words
and
i
replied
thou
shalt
receive
from
me
everything
that
thou
canst
wish
she
then
said
i
went
yesterday
to
the
damsel
and
when
she
beheld
me
with
broken
heart
and
weeping
eye
she
said
to
me
o
my
aunt
wherefore
do
i
see
thee
with
contracted
heartâand
when331
she
had
thus
said
i
wept
and
answered
o
my
daughter
and
mistress
i
came
to
thee
yesterday
from
visiting
a
youth
who
loveth
thee
and
he
is
at
the
point
of
death
on
thy
accountâand
her
heart
being
moved
with
compassion
she
asked
who
is
this
youth
of
whom
thou
speakest
i
answered
he
is
my
son
and
the
child
that
is
dear
to
my
soul
he
saw
thee
at
the
window
some
days
ago
while
thou
wast
watering
thy
flowers
and
when
he
beheld
thy
face
he
became
distracted
with
love
for
thee
i
informed
him
of
the
conversation
that
i
had
with
thee
the
first
time
upon
which
his
disorder
increased
and
he
took
to
his
pillow
he
is
now
dying
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
fateâand
upon
this
her
countenance
became
pale
and
she
said
is
this
all
on
my
accountâyea
by
allah
i
answered
and
what
dost
thou
order
me
to
doâgo
to
him
said
she
convey
to
him
my
salutation
and
tell
him
that
my
love
is
greater
than
his
and
on
friday
next
before
the
congregational
prayers
let
him
come
hither
i
will
give
orders
to
open
the
door
to
him
and
to
bring
him
up
to
me
and
i
will
have
a
short
interview
with
him
and
he
shall
return
before
my
father
comes
back
from
the
prayers

when
i
heard
these
words
of
the
old
woman
the
anguish
which
i
had
suffered
ceased
my
heart
was
set
at
rest
and
i
gave
her
the
suit
of
clothes
which
i
was
then
wearing
and
she
departed
saying
to
me
cheer
up
thy
heart
i
replied
i
have
no
longer
any
pain
the
people
of
my
house
and
my
friends
communicated
one
to
another
the
good
news
of
my
restoration
to
health
and
i
remained
thus
until
the
friday
when
the
old
woman
came
in
to
me
and
asked
me
respecting
my
state
so
i
informed
her
that
i
was
happy
and
well
i
then
dressed
and
perfumed
myself
and
sat
waiting
for
the
people
to
go
to
prayers
that
i
might
repair
to
the
damsel
but
the
old
woman
said
to
me
thou
hast
yet
more
than
ample
time
and
if
thou
go
to
the
bath
and
shave
especially
for
the
sake
of
obliterating
the
traces
of
thy
disorder
it
will
be
more
becomingâit
is
a
judicious
piece
of
advice
replied
i
but
i
will
shave
my
head
first
and
then
go
into
the
bath

the
barber
and
the
young
man
so
i
sent
for
a
barber
to
shave
my
head
saying
to
the
boy
go
to
the
market
and
bring
me
a
barber
one
who
is
a
man
of
sense
little
inclined
to
impertinence
that
he
may
not
make
my
head
ache
by
his
chattering
and
the
boy
went
and
brought
this
sheykh
who
on
entering
saluted
me
and
when
i
had
returned
his
salutation
he
said
to
me
may
god
dispel
thy
grief
and
thine
anxiety
and
misfortunes
and
sorrows
i
responded
may
god
accept
thy
prayer
he
then
said
be
cheerful
o
my
master
for
health
hath
returned
to
thee332
dost
thou
desire
to
be
shaved
or
to
be
bledâfor
it
hath
been
handed
down
on
the
authority
of
ibn-abbÃs56
that
the
prophet
said
whoso
shorteneth
his
hair
on
friday
god
will
avert
from
him
seventy
diseasesâand
it
hath
been
handed
down
also
on
the
same
authority
that
the
prophet
said
whoso
is
cupped
on
friday
will
not
be
secure
from
the
loss
of
sight
and
from
frequent
diseaseâabstain
said
i
from
this
useless
discourse
and
come
immediately
shave
my
head
for
i
am
weak
and
he
arose
and
stretching
forth
his
hand
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
opened
it
and
lo
there
was
in
it
an
astrolabe
consisting
of
seven
plates57
and
he
took
it
and
went
into
the
middle
of
the
court
where
he
raised
his
head
towards
the
sun
and
looked
for
a
considerable
time
after
which
he
said
to
me
know
that
there
have
passed
of
this
our
day
which
is
friday
and
which
is
the
tenth
of
áafar58
of
the
year
26359
of
the
flight
of
the
prophetâupon
whom
be
the
most
excellent
of
blessings
and
peaceâand
the
ascendant
star
of
which
according
to
the
required
rules
of
the
science
of
computation
is
the
planet
marsâseven
degrees60
and
six
minutes
and
it
happeneth
that
mercury
hath
come
in
conjunction
with
that
planet
and
this
indicateth
that
the
shaving
of
hair
is
now
a
most
excellent
operation
and
it
hath
indicated
to
me
also
that
thou
desirest
to
confer
a
benefit
upon
a
person
and
fortunate
is
heâbut
after
that
there
is
an
an333nouncement
that
presenteth
itself
to
me
respecting
a
matter
which
i
will
not
mention
to
thee

by
allah
i
exclaimed
thou
hast
wearied
me
and
dissipated
my
mind
and
augured
against
me
when
i
required
thee
only
to
shave
my
head
arise
then
and
shave
it
and
prolong
not
thy
discourse
to
me
but
he
replied
by
allah
if
thou
knewest
the
truth
of
the
case
thou
wouldst
demand
of
me
a
further
explication
and
i
counsel
thee
to
do
this
day
as
i
direct
thee
according
to
the
calculations
deduced
from
the
stars
it
is
thy
duty
to
praise
god
and
not
to
oppose
me
for
i
am
one
who
giveth
thee
good
advice
and
who
regardeth
thee
with
compassion
i
would
that
i
were
in
thy
service
for
a
whole
year
that
thou
mightest
do
me
justice
and
i
desire
not
any
pay
from
thee
for
so
doingâwhen
i
heard
this
i
said
to
him
verily
thou
art
killing
me
this
day
and
there
is
no
escape
for
meâo
my
master
he
replied
i
am
he
whom
the
people
call
eá-áÃmit61
on
account
of
the
paucity
of
my
speech
by
which
i
am
distinguished
above
my
brothers
for
my
eldest
brother
is
named
el-baábooá62
and
the
second
el-heddÃr
and
the
third
baábaá
and
the
fourth
is
named
el-kooz
el-aáwÃnee
and
the
fifth
el-feshshÃr
and
the
sixth
is
named
shaáÃliá
and
the
seventh
brother
is
named
eá-áÃmit
and
he
is
myself

now
when
this
barber
thus
overwhelmed
me
with
his
talk
i
felt
as
if
my
gall-bladder
had
burst
and
said
to
the
boy
give
him
a
quarter
of
a
piece
of
gold
and
let
him
depart
from
me
for
the
sake
of
allah
for
i
have
no
need
to
shave
my
head
but
the
barber
on
hearing
what
i
said
to
the
boy
exclaimed
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
said
o
my
lord
by
allah
i
will
accept
from
thee
no
pay
unless
i
serve
thee
and
serve
thee
i
must
for
to
do
so
is
incumbent
on
me
and
to
perform
what
thou
requirest
and
i
care
not
if
i
receive
from
thee
no
money
if
thou
knowest
not
my
worth
i
know
thine
and
thy
fatherâmay
allah
have
mercy
upon
himâtreated
us
with
beneficence
for
he
was
a
man
of
generosity
by
allah
thy
father
sent
for
me
one
day
like
this
blessed
day
and
when
i
went
to
him
he
had
a
number
of
his
friends
with
him
and
he
said
to
me
take
some
blood
from
me
so
i
took
the
astrolabe
and
observed
the
altitude
for
him
and
found
the
ascendant
of
the
hour
to
be
of
evil
omen
and
that
the
letting
of
blood
would
be
attended
with
trouble
i
therefore
acquainted
him
with
this
and
he
conformed
to
my
wish
and
waited
until
the
arrival
of
the
approved
hour
when
i
took
the
blood
from
him
he
did
not
oppose
me
but
on
the
contrary
thanked
me
and
in
like334
manner
all
the
company
present
thanked
me
and
thy
father
gave
me
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
for
services
similar
to
the
letting
of
bloodâmay
god
said
i
shew
no
mercy
to
my
father
for
knowing
such
a
man
as
thouâand
the
barber
laughed
and
exclaimed
there
is
no
deity
but
god
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
changeth
others
but
is
not
changed
i
did
not
imagine
thee
to
be
otherwise
than
a
man
of
sense
but
thou
hast
talked
nonsense
in
consequence
of
thine
illness
god
hath
mentioned
in
his
excellent
book
those
who
restrain
their
anger
and
who
forgive
men63âbut
thou
art
excused
in
every
case
i
am
unacquainted
however
with
the
cause
of
thy
haste
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
father
used
to
do
nothing
without
consulting
me
and
it
hath
been
said
that
the
person
to
whom
one
applies
for
advice
should
be
trusted
now
thou
wilt
find
no
one
better
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
world
than
myself
and
i
am
standing
on
my
feet
to
serve
thee
i
am
not
displeased
with
thee
and
how
then
art
thou
displeased
with
me
but
i
will
have
patience
with
thee
on
account
of
the
favours
which
i
have
received
from
thy
fatherâby
allah
said
i
thou
hast
wearied
me
with
thy
discourse
and
overcome
me
with
thy
speech
i
desire
that
thou
shave
my
head
and
depart
from
me

i
gave
vent
to
my
rage
and
would
have
risen
even
if
he
had
wetted
my
head
when
he
said
i
knew
that
displeasure
with
me
had
overcome
thee
but
i
will
not
be
angry
with
thee
for
thy
sense
is
weak
and
thou
art
a
youth
a
short
time
ago
i
used
to
carry
thee
on
my
shoulder64
and
take
thee
to
the
schoolâupon
this
i
said
to
him
o
my
brother
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
depart
from
me
that
i
may
perform
my
business
and
go
thou
thy
way
then
i
rent
my
clothes
and
when
he
saw
me
do
this
he
took
the
razor
and
sharpened
it
and
continued
to
do
so
until
my
soul
almost
parted
from
my
body
then
advancing
to
my
head
he
shaved
a
small
portion
of
it
after
which
he
raised
his
hand
and
said
o
my
lord
haste
is
from
the
devilâand
he
repeated
this
coupletâ

deliberate
and
haste
not
to
accomplish
thy
desire
and
be
merciful
so
shalt
thou
meet
with
one
merciful
for
there
is
no
hand
but
gods
hand
is
above
it65
nor
oppressor
that
shall
not
meet
with
an
oppressor
o
my
lord
he
then
continued
i
do
not
imagine
that
thou
knowest
my
condition
in
society
for
my
hand
lighteth
upon
the
heads
of
kings
and
emeers
and
wezeers
and
sages
and
learned
men
and
of
such
a
one
as
myself
hath
the
poet
said335â

the
trades
altogether
are
like
a
necklace
and
this
barber
is
the
chief
pearl
of
the
strings
he
excelleth
all
that
are
endowed
with
skill
and
under
his
hands
are
the
heads
of
kings
âleave
said
i
that
which
doth
not
concern
thee
thou
hast
contracted
my
heart
and
troubled
my
mindâi
fancy
that
thou
art
in
haste
he
rejoined
i
replied
yes
yes
yesâproceed
slowly
said
he
for
verily
haste
is
from
the
devil
and
it
giveth
occasion
to
repentance
and
disappointment
and
he
upon
whom
be
blessing
and
peace66
hath
said
the
best
of
affairs
is
that
which
is
commenced
with
deliberationâand
by
allah
i
am
in
doubt
as
to
thine
affair
i
wish
therefore
that
thou
wouldst
make
known
to
me
what
thou
art
hasting
to
do
and
may
it
be
good
for
i
fear
it
is
otherwise

there
now
remained
to
the
appointed
time
three
hours
and
he
threw
the
razor
from
his
hand
in
anger
and
taking
the
astrolabe
went
again
to
observe
the
sun
then
after
he
had
waited
a
long
time
he
returned
saying
there
remain
to
the
hour
of
prayer
three
hours
neither
more
nor
less
for
the
sake
of
allah
said
i
be
silent
for
thou
hast
crumbled
my
liverâand
thereupon
he
took
the
razor
and
sharpened
it
as
he
had
done
the
first
time
and
shaved
another
portion
of
my
head
then
stopping
again
he
said
i
am
in
anxiety
on
account
of
thy
hurry
if
thou
wouldst
acquaint
me
with
the
cause
of
it
it
would
be
better
for
thee
for
thou
knowest
that
thy
father
used
to
do
nothing
without
consulting
me

i
perceived
now
that
i
could
not
avoid
his
importunity
and
said
within
myself
the
time
of
prayer
is
almost
come
and
i
desire
to
go
before
the
people
come
out
from
the
service
if
i
delay
a
little
longer
i
know
not
how
to
gain
admission
to
her
i
therefore
said
to
him
be
quick
and
cease
from
this
chattering
and
impertinence
for
i
desire
to
repair
to
an
entertainment
with
my
friends
but
when
he
heard
the
mention
of
the
entertainment
he
exclaimed
the
day
is
a
blessed
day
for
me
i
yesterday
conjured
a
party
of
my
intimate
friends
to
come
and
feast
with
me
and
forgot
to
prepare
for
them
anything
to
eat
and
now
i
have
remembered
it
alas
for
the
disgrace
that
i
shall
experience
from
themâso
i
said
to
him
be
in
no
anxiety
on
this
account
since
thou
hast
been
told
that
i
am
going
to-day
to
an
entertainment
for
all
the
food
and
drink
that
is
in
my
house
shall
be
thine
if
thou
use
expedition
in
my
affair
and
quickly
finish
shaving
my
headâmay
god
recompense
thee
with
every
blessing
he
replied
describe
to
me
what
thou
hast
for
my
guests
that
i
may
know
it
i
have
said
i
five
dishes
of
meat
and
ten
fowls
fricandoed
336
and
a
roasted
lambâcause
them
to
be
brought
before
me
he
said
that
i
may
see
them
so
i
had
them
brought
to
him
and
he
exclaimed
divinely
art
thou
gifted
how
generous
is
thy
soul
but
the
incense
and
perfumes
are
wantingâi
brought
him
therefore
a
box
containing
nedd67
and
aloes-wood
and
ambergris
and
musk
worth
fifty
pieces
of
goldâthe
time
had
now
become
contracted
like
my
own
heart
so
i
said
to
him
receive
this
and
shave
the
whole
of
my
head
by
the
existence
of
moáammad
god
bless
and
save
him
but
he
replied
by
allah
i
will
not
take
it
until
i
see
all
that
it
containsâi
therefore
ordered
the
boy
and
he
opened
the
box
to
him
whereupon
the
barber
threw
down
the
astrolabe
from
his
hand
and
seating
himself
upon
the
ground
turned
over
the
perfumes
and
incense
and
aloes-wood
in
the
box
until
my
soul
almost
quitted
my
body

the
barber
and
servants
with
dishes
he
then
advanced
and
took
the
razor
and
shaved
another
small
portion
of
my
head
after
which
he
said
by
allah
o
my
son
i
know
not
whether
i
should
thank
thee
or
thank
thy
father
for
my
entertainment
to-day
is
entirely
derived
from
thy
bounty
and
kindness
and
i
have
no
one
among
my
visiters
deserving
of
it
for
my
guests
are
zeytoon
the
bath-keeper
and
áaleeáº
the
wheat-seller
and
owkal
the
bean-seller
and
akresheh
the
grocer
and
áomeyd
the
dustman
and
akÃrish
the
milk-seller
and
each
of
these
hath
a
peculiar
dance
which
he
performeth
and
peculiar
verses
which
he
reciteth
and
the
best
of
their
qualities
is
that
they
are
like
thy
servant
the
memlook
who
is
before
thee
and
i
thy
slave
know
neither
loquacity
nor
impertinence
as
to
the
bath-keeper
he
saith
if
i
go
not
to
the
feast
it
cometh
to
my
houseâand
as
to
the
dustman
he
is
witty
and
full
of
frolick
often
doth
he
dance
and
say
news
with
my
wife
is
not
kept
in
a

each
of
my
friends
hath
jests
that
another337
hath
not
but
the
description
is
not
like
the
actual
observation
if
thou
choose
therefore
to
come
to
us
it
will
be
more
pleasant
both
to
thee
and
to
us
relinquish
then
thy
visit
to
thy
friends
of
whom
thou
hast
told
us
that
thou
desirest
to
go
to
them
for
the
traces
of
disease
are
yet
upon
thee
and
probably
thou
art
going
to
a
people
of
many
words
who
will
talk
of
that
which
concerneth
them
not
or
probably
there
will
be
among
them
one
impertinent
person
and
thy
soul
is
already
disquieted
by
diseaseâi
replied
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
that
shall
be
on
some
other
dayâbut
he
said
it
will
be
more
proper
that
thou
first
join
my
party
of
friends
that
thou
mayest
enjoy
their
conviviality
and
delight
thyself
with
their
salt
act
in
accordance
with
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

defer
not
a
pleasure
when
it
can
be
had
for
fortune
often
destroyeth
our
plans
upon
this
i
laughed
from
a
heart
laden
with
anger
and
said
to
him
do
what
i
require
that
i
may
go
in
the
care
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
do
thou
go
to
thy
friends
for
they
are
waiting
thine
arrival
he
replied
i
desire
nothing
but
to
introduce
thee
into
the
society
of
these
people
for
verily
they
are
of
the
sons
of
that
class
among
which
is
no
impertinent
person
and
if
thou
didst
but
behold
them
once
thou
wouldst
leave
all
thine
own
companionsâmay
god
said
i
give
thee
abundant
joy
with
them
and
i
must
bring
them
together
here
some
dayâif
that
be
thy
wish
he
rejoined
and
thou
wilt
first
attend
the
entertainment
of
thy
friends
this
day
wait
until
i
take
this
present
with
which
thou
hast
honoured
me
and
place
it
before
my
friends
that
they
may
eat
and
drink
without
waiting
for
me
and
then
i
will
return
to
thee
and
go
with
thee
to
thy
companions
for
there
is
no
false
delicacy
between
me
and
my
companions
that
should
prevent
my
leaving
them
so
i
will
return
to
thee
quickly
and
repair
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
goestâupon
this
i
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
go
thou
to
thy
companions
and
delight
thy
heart
with
them
and
leave
me
to
repair
to
mine
and
to
remain
with
them
this
day
for
they
are
waiting
my
arrivalâbut
he
said
i
will
not
leave
thee
to
go
aloneâthe
place
to
which
i
am
going
said
i
none
can
enter
except
myselfâi
suppose
then
he
rejoined
that
thou
hast
an
appointment
to-day
with
some
female
otherwise
thou
wouldst
take
me
with
thee
for
i
am
more
deserving
than
all
other
men
and
will
assist
thee
to
attain
what
thou
desirest
i
fear
that
thou
art
going
to
visit
some
strange
woman
and
that
thy
life
will
be
lost
for
in
this
city
of
baghdÃd
no338
one
can
do
anything
of
this
kind
especially
on
such
a
day
as
this
seeing
that
the
wÃlee
of
baghdÃd
is
a
terrible
sharp
swordâwo
to
thee
o
wicked
old
man
i
exclaimed
what
are
these
words
with
which
thou
addressest
meâand
upon
this
he
kept
a
long
silence

the
time
of
prayer
had
now
arrived
and
the
time
of
the
khuábeh68
was
near
when
he
had
finished
shaving
my
head
so
i
said
to
him
go
with
this
food
and
drink
to
thy
friends
and
i
will
wait
for
thee
until
thou
return
and
thou
shalt
accompany
meâand
i
continued
my
endeavours
to
deceive
him
that
he
might
go
away
but
he
said
to
me
verily
thou
art
deceiving
me
and
wilt
go
alone
and
precipitate
thyself
into
a
calamity
from
which
there
will
be
no
escape
for
thee
by
allah
by
allah
then
quit
not
this
spot
until
i
return
to
thee
and
accompany
thee
that
i
may
know
what
will
be
the
result
of
thine
affairâi
replied
well
prolong
not
thine
absence
from
me
and
he
took
the
food
and
drink
and
other
things
which
i
had
given
him
but
intrusted
them
to
a
porter
to
convey
them
to
his
abode
and
concealed
himself
in
one
of
the
by-streets
i
then
immediately
arose
the
muÃddins
on
the
menÃrehs
had
chanted
the
selÃm
of
friday69
and
i
put
on
my
clothes
and
went
forth
alone
and
arriving
at
the
by-street
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
i
had
seen
the
damsel
and
lo
the
barber
was
behind
me
and
i
knew
it
not
i
found
the
door
open
and
entered
and
immediately
the
master
of
the
house
returned
from
the
prayers
and
entered
the
saloon
and
closed
the
door
and
i
said
within
myself
how
did
this
devil
discover
me

now
it
happened
just
at
this
time
for
the
fulfilment
of
gods
purpose
to
rend
the
veil
of
protection
before
me
that
a
female
slave
belonging
to
the
master
of
the
house
committed
some
offence
in
consequence
of
which
he
beat
her
and
she
cried
out
whereupon
a
male
slave
came
in
to
him
to
liberate
her
but
he
beat
him
also
and
he
likewise
cried
out
and
the
barber
concluded
that
he
was
beating
me
so
he
cried
and
rent
his
clothes
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
his
head
shrieking
and
calling
for
assistance
he
was
surrounded
by
people
and
said
to
them
my
master
hath
been
killed
in
the
house
of
the
áÃáee
then
running
to
my
house
crying
out
all
the
while
and
with
a
crowd
behind
him
he
gave
the
news
to
my
family
and
i
knew
not
what
he
had
done
when
they
approached
crying
alas
for
our
masterâthe
barber
all
the
while
being
before
them
with
his
clothes
rent
and
a
number
of
the
people
of
the
city
with
them
they
continued
shrieking
the
barber
shrieking
at
their
head
and
all
of
them
exclaiming
alas
for
our
slainâthus
they
advanced
to
the
house
in339
which
i
was
confined
and
when
the
áÃáee
heard
of
this
occurrence
the
event
troubled
him
and
he
arose
and
opened
the
door
and
seeing
a
great
crowd
he
was
confounded
and
said
o
people
what
is
the
news
the
servants
replied
thou
hast
killed
our
masterâo
people
rejoined
he
what
hath
your
master
done
unto
me
that
i
should
kill
him
and
wherefore
do
i
see
this
barber
before
youâthou
hast
just
now
beaten
him
with
miáraahs
said
the
barber
and
i
heard
his
criesâwhat
hath
he
done
that
i
should
kill
him
repeated
the
áÃáee
and
whence
he
added
came
he
and
whither
would
he
goâbe
not
an
old
man
of
malevolence
exclaimed
the
barber
for
i
know
the
story
and
the
reason
of
his
entering
thy
house
and
the
truth
of
the
whole
affair
thy
daughter
is
in
love
with
him
and
he
is
in
love
with
her
and
thou
hast
discovered
that
he
had
entered
thy
house
and
hast
ordered
thy
young
men
and
they
have
beaten
him
by
allah
none
shall
decide
between
us
and
thee
except
the
khaleefeh
or
thou
shalt
bring
forth
to
us
our
master
that
his
family
may
take
him
and
oblige
me
not
to
enter
and
take
him
forth
from
you
haste
then
thyself
to
produce
him

the
barber
rending
his
clothes
upon
this
the
áÃáee
was
withheld
from
speaking
and
became
utterly
abashed
before
the
people
but
presently
he
said
to
the
barber
if
thou
speak
truth
enter
thyself
and
bring
him
forth
so
the
barber
advanced
and
entered
the
house
and
when
i
saw
him
do
so
i
sought
for
a
way
to
escape
but
i
found
no
place
of
refuge
except
a
large
chest
which
i
observed
in
the
same
apartment
in
which
i
then340
was
i
therefore
entered
this
and
shut
down
the
lid
and
held
in
my
breath
immediately
after
the
barber
ran
into
the
saloon
and
without
looking
in
any
other
direction
than
that
in
which
i
had
concealed
myself
came
thither
then
turning
his
eyes
to
the
right
and
left
and
seeing
nothing
but
the
chest
he
raised
it
upon
his
head
whereupon
my
reason
forsook
me
he
quickly
descended
with
it
and
i
being
now
certain
that
he
would
not
quit
me
opened
the
chest
and
threw
myself
upon
the
ground
my
leg
was
broken
by
the
fall
and
when
i
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
i
found
a
multitude
of
people
i
had
never
seen
such
a
crowd
as
was
there
collected
on
that
day
so
i
began
to
scatter
gold
among
them
to
divert
them
and
while
they
were
busied
in
picking
it
up
i
hastened
through
the
by-streets
of
baghdÃd
followed
by
this
barber
and
wherever
i
entered
he
entered
after
me
crying
they
would
have
plunged
me
into
affliction
on
account
of
my
master
praise
be
to
god
who
aided
me
against
them
and
delivered
my
master
from
their
hands
thou
continuedst
o
my
master
to
be
excited
by
haste
for
the
accomplishment
of
thine
evil
design
until
thou
broughtest
upon
thyself
this
event
and
if
god
had
not
blessed
thee
with
me
thou
hadst
not
escaped
from
this
calamity
into
which
thou
hast
fallen
and
they
might
have
involved
thee
in
a
calamity
from
which
thou
wouldst
never
have
escaped
beg
therefore
of
god
that
i
may
live
for
thy
sake
to
liberate
thee
in
future
by
allah
thou
hast
almost
destroyed
me
by
thine
evil
design
desiring
to
go
alone
but
we
will
not
be
angry
with
thee
for
thine
ignorance
for
thou
art
endowed
with
little
sense
and
of
a
hasty
dispositionâart
thou
not
satisfied
replied
i
with
that
which
thou
hast
done
but
wilt
thou
run
after
me
through
the
market-streetsâand
i
desired
for
death
to
liberate
me
from
him
but
found
it
not
and
in
the
excess
of
my
rage
i
ran
from
him
and
entering
a
shop
in
the
midst
of
the
market
implored
the
protection
of
its
owner
and
he
drove
away
the
barber
from
me

i
then
seated
myself
in
a
magazine
belonging
to
him
and
said
within
myself
i
cannot
now
rid
myself
of
this
barber
but
he
will
be
with
me
night
and
day
and
i
cannot
endure
the
sight
of
his
face
so
i
immediately
summoned
witnesses
and
wrote
a
document
dividing
my
property
among
my
family
and
appointing
a
guardian
over
them
and
i
ordered
him
to
sell
the
house
and
all
the
immoveable
possessions
charging
him
with
the
care
of
the
old
and
young
and
set
forth
at
once
on
a
journey
in
order
to
escape
from
this
wretch
i
then
arrived
in
your
country
where
i
took
up
my
abode
and
have
remained
a341
considerable
time
and
when
ye
invited
me
and
i
came
unto
you
i
saw
this
vile
wretch
among
you
seated
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
how
then
can
my
heart
be
at
ease
or
my
sitting
in
your
company
be
pleasant
to
me
with
this
fellow
who
hath
brought
these
events
upon
me
and
been
the
cause
of
the
breaking
of
my
leg

the
young
man
still
persevered
in
his
refusal
to
remain
with
us
and
when
we
had
heard
his
story
we
said
to
the
barber
is
this
true
which
the
young
man
hath
said
of
theeâby
allah
he
answered
it
was
through
my
intelligence
that
i
acted
thus
towards
him
and
had
i
not
done
so
he
had
perished
myself
only
was
the
cause
of
his
escape
and
it
was
through
the
goodness
of
god
by
my
means
that
he
was
afflicted
by
the
breaking
of
his
leg
instead
of
being
punished
by
the
loss
of
his
life
were
i
a
person
of
many
words
i
had
not
done
him
this
kindness
and
now
i
will
relate
to
you
an
event
that
happened
to
me
that
ye
may
believe
me
to
be
a
man
of
few
words
and
less
of
an
impertinent
than
my
brothers
and
it
was
thisâ

portrait
of
the
barber
342

head-piece
to
the
barbers
story
of
himself
the
barbers
story
of
himself

i
was
living
in
baghdÃd
in
the
reign
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
el-muntaáir
bi-llÃh70
who
loved
the
poor
and
indigent
and
associated
with
the
learned
and
virtuous
and
it
happened
one
day
that
he
was
incensed
against
ten
persons
in
consequence
of
which
he
ordered
the
chief
magistrate
of
baghdÃd
to
bring
them
to
him
in
a
boat
i
saw
them
and
i
said
within
myself
these
persons
have
assembled
for
nothing
but
an
entertainment
and
i
suppose
will
pass
their
day
in
this
boat
eating
and
drinking
and
none
shall
be
their
companion
but
myself71âso
i
embarked
and
mixed
myself
among
them
and
when
they
had
landed
on
the
opposite
bank
the
guards
of
the
wÃlee
came
with
chains
and
put
them
upon
their
necks
and
put
a
chain
upon
my
neck
alsoânow
this
o
people
is
it
not
a
proof
of
my
generosity
and
of
my
paucity
of
speech
for
i
determined
not
to
speakâthey
took
us
therefore
all
together
in
chains
and
placed
us
before
el-muntaáir
bi-llÃh
the
prince
of
the
faithful
whereupon
he
gave
orders
to
strike
off
the
heads
of
the
ten
and
the
executioner
struck
off
the
heads
of
the
ten
and
i
remained
the
khaleefeh
then
turning
his
eyes
and
beholding
me
said
to
the
executioner
wherefore
dost
thou
not
strike
off
the
heads
of
all
the
ten
he
answered
i
have
beheaded
every
one
of
the
tenâi
do
not
think
rejoined
the
khaleefeh
that
thou
hast
beheaded
more
than
nine
and
this
who
is
before
me
is
the
tenth
but
the
executioner
replied
by
thy
beneficence
they
are
tenâcount
them
said
the
khaleefeh
and
they
counted
them
and
lo
they
were
ten
the
khaleefeh
then
looked343
towards
me
and
said
what
hath
induced
thee
to
be
silent
on
this
occasion
and
how
hast
thou
become
included
among
the
men
of
bloodâand
when
i
heard
the
address
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
i
said
to
him
know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
i
am
the
sheykh
eá-áÃmit
the
silent
i
possess
of
science
a
large
stock
and
as
to
the
gravity
of
my
understanding
and
the
quickness
of
my
apprehension
and
the
paucity
of
my
speech
they
are
unbounded
my
trade
is
that
of
a
barber
and
yesterday
early
in
the
morning
i
saw
these
ten
men
proceeding
to
the
boat
whereupon
i
mixed
myself
with
them
and
embarked
with
them
thinking
that
they
had
met
together
for
an
entertainment
but
soon
it
appeared
that
they
were
criminals
and
the
guards
came
to
them
and
put
chains
upon
their
necks
and
upon
my
neck
also
they
put
a
chain
and
from
the
excess
of
my
generosity
i
was
silent
and
spoke
not
my
speech
was
not
heard
on
that
occasion
on
account
of
the
excess
of
my
generosity
and
they
proceeded
with
us
until
they
stationed
us
before
thee
and
thou
gavest
the
order
to
strike
off
the
heads
of
the
ten
and
i
remained
before
the
executioner
and
acquainted
you
not
with
my
case
was
not
this
great
generosity
which
compelled
me
to
accompany
them
to
slaughter
but
throughout
my
life
i
have
acted
in
this
excellent
manner

when
the
khaleefeh
heard
my
words
and
knew
that
i
was
of
a
very
generous
character
and
of
few
words
and
not
inclined
to
impertinence
as
this
young
man
whom
i
delivered
from
horrors
asserteth
he
said
hast
thou
brothers
i
answered
yes
sixâand

thyself
distinguished
by
science
and
knowledge
and
paucity
of
speech
i
answered
they
lived
not
so
as
to
be
like
me
thou
hast
disparaged
me
by
thy
supposition
o
prince
of
the
faithful
and
it
is
not
proper
that
thou
shouldst
compare
my
brothers
to
me
for
through
the
abundance
of
their
speech
and
the
smallness
of
their
generous
qualities
each
of
them
experienced
a
defect
the
first
was
lame
the
second
deprived
of
many
of
his
teeth
the
third
blind
the
fourth
one-eyed
the
fifth
cropped

that
i
am
a
man
of
many
words
nay
i
must
prove
to
thee
that
i
am
of
a
more
generous
character
than
they
and
each
of
them
met
with
a
particular
adventure
in

of
which

experienced
a
defect

story
of
his
first
brother--the
motto

different

to-night
from
yesterday
the
barbers
story
of
his
first
brother

know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
the
first
who
was
named
el-baábooá
was
the
lame
one
he
practised
the
art
of
a
tailor
in
baghdÃd
and
used
to
sew
in
a
shop
which
he
hired
of
a
man
possessing
great
wealth
who
lived
over
the
shop
and
who
had
in
the
lower
part
of
his
house
a
mill
and
as
my
lame
brother
was
sitting
in
his
shop
one
day
sewing
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
a
woman
like
the
rising
full
moon
at
a
projecting
window
of
the
house
looking
at
the
people
passing
by
and
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
his
heart
was
entangled
by
her
love
he
passed
that
day
gazing
at
her
and
neglecting
his
occupation
until
the
evening
and
on
the
following
morning
he
opened
his
shop
and
sat
down
to
sew
but
every
time
that
he
sewed
a
stitch
he
looked
towards
the
window
and
in
this
state
he
continued
sewing
nothing
sufficient
to
earn
a
piece
of
silver73

on
the
third
day
he
seated
himself
again
in
his
place
looking
towards
the
woman
and
she
saw
him
and
perceiving
that
he
had
become
enslaved
by
her
love
laughed
in
his
face
and
he
in
like
manner
laughed
in
her
face
she
then
disappeared
from
before
him
and
sent
to
him
her
slave-girl
with
a
wrapper
containing
a
piece
of
red
flowered
silk
and
the
girl
coming
to
him
said
to
him
my
mistress
saluteth
thee
and
desireth
thee
to
cut
out
for
her
with
the
hand
of
skill
a
shirt
of
this
piece
and
to
sew
it
beautifully
so
he
answered
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
cut
out
for
her
the
shirt
and
finished
the
sewing
of
it
on
that
day
and
on
the
following
day
the345
slave-girl
came
to
him
again
and
said
to
him
my
mistress
saluteth
thee
and
saith
to
thee
how
didst
thou
pass
last
nightâfor
she
tasted
not
sleep
from
her
passion
for
theeâshe
then
placed
before
him
a
piece
of
yellow
satin
and
said
to
him
my
mistress
desireth
thee
to
cut
out
for
her
of
this
piece
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
to
make
them
this
day
he
replied
i
hear
and
obey
salute
her
with
abundant
salutations
and
say
to
her
thy
slave
is
submissive
to
thine
order
and
command
him
to
do
whatsoever
thou
wiltâhe
then
busied
himself
with
the
cutting
out
and
used
all
diligence
in
sewing
the
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
presently
the
woman
looked
out
at
him
from
the
window
and
saluted
him
by
a
sign
now
casting
down
her
eyes
and
now
smiling
in
his
face
so
that
he
imagined
he
should
soon
obtain
possession
of
her
after
this
she
disappeared
from
before
him
and
the
slave-girl
came
to
him
so
he
delivered
to
her
the
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
she
took
them
and
departed
and
when
the
night
came
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
remained
turning
himself
over
in
restlessness
until
the
morning

on
the
following
day
the
master
of
the
house
came
to
my
brother
bringing
some
linen
and
said
to
him
cut
out
and
make
this
into
shirts
for
me
he
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
ceased
not
from
his
work
until
he
had
cut
out
twenty
shirts
by
the
time
of
nightfall
without
having
tasted
food
the
man
then
said
to
him
how
much
is
thy
hire
for
thisâbut
my
brother
answered
not
and
the
damsel
made
a
sign
to
him
that
he
should
receive
nothing
though
he
was
absolutely
in
want
of
a
single
copper
coin
for
three
days
he
continued
scarcely
eating
or
drinking
anything
in
his
diligence
to
accomplish
his
work
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
went
to
deliver
the
shirts

now
the
young
woman
had
acquainted
her
husband
with
the
state
of
my
brothers
mind
but
my
brother
knew
not
this
and
she
planned
with
her
husband
to
employ
him
in
sewing
without
remuneration
and
moreover
to
amuse
themselves
by
laughing
at
him
so
when
he
had
finished
all
the
work
that
they
gave
him
they
contrived
a
plot
against
him
and
married
him
to
their
slave-girl
and
on
the
night
when
he
desired
to
introduce
himself
to
her
they
said
to
him
pass
this
night
in
the
mill
and
to-morrow
thou
shalt
enjoy
happiness
my
brother
therefore
thinking
that
their
intention
was
good
passed
the
night
in
the
mill
alone
meanwhile
the
husband
of
the
young
woman
went
to
the
miller
and
instigated
him
by
signs
to
make
my
brother
turn
the
mill
the
miller
accordingly
went
in
to
him
at
midnight
and
began
to
exclaim
verily
this
bull
is
lazy
while
there
is
a
great
quantity
of346
wheat
and
the
owners
of
the
flour
are
demanding
it
i
will
therefore
yoke
him
in
the
mill
that
he
may
finish
the
grinding
of
the
flourâand
so
saying
he
yoked
my
brother
and
thus
he
kept
him
until
near
morning
when
the
owner
of
the
house
came
and
saw
him
yoked
in
the
mill
and
the
miller
flogging
him
with
the
whip
and
he
left
him
and
retired
after
this
the
slave-girl
to
whom
he
had
been
contracted
in
marriage
came
to
him
early
in
the
morning
and
having
unbound
him
from
the
mill
said
to
him
both
i
and
my
mistress
have
been
distressed
by
this
which
hath
befallen
thee
and
we
have
participated
in
the
burden
of
thy
sorrow
but
he
had
no
tongue
wherewith
to
answer
her
by
reason
of
the
severity
of
the
flogging
he
then
returned
to
his
house
and
lo
the
sheykh
who
had
performed
the
marriage-contract
came
and
saluted
him
saying
may
god
prolong
thy
life
may
thy
marriage
be
blessedâmay
god
not
preserve
the
liar
returned
my
brother
thou
thousandfold
villain
by
allah
i
went
only
to
turn
the
mill
in
the
place
of
the
bull
until
the
morningâtell
me
thy
story
said
the
sheykhâand
my
brother
told
him
what
had
happened
to
him
upon
which
the
sheykh
said
thy
star
agreeth
not
with
hers
but
if
thou
desire
that
i
should
change
for
thee
the
mode
of
the
contract
i
will
change
it
for
another
better
than
it
that
thy
star
may
agree
with
hers74âsee
then
replied
my
brother
if
thou
hast
any
other
contrivance
to
employ

my
brother
then
left
him
and
repaired
again
to
his
shop
hoping
that
somebody
might
give
him
some
work
with
the
profit
of
which
he
might
obtain
his
food
and
lo
the
slave-girl
came
to
him
she
had
conspired
with
her
mistress
to
play
him
this
trick
and
said
to
him
verily
my
mistress
is
longing
for
thee
and
she
hath
gone
up
to
look
at
thy
face
from
the
window
and
my
brother
had
scarcely
heard
these
words
when
she
looked
out
at
him
from
the
window
and
weeping
said
wherefore
hast
thou
cut
short
the
intercourse
between
us
and
thee
but
he
returned
her
no
answer
so
she
swore
to
him
that
all
that
had
happened
to
him
in
the
mill
was
not
with
her
consent
and
when
my
brother
beheld
her
beauty
and
loveliness
the
troubles
that
had
befallen
him
became
effaced
from
his
memory
and
he
accepted
her
excuse
and
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
her
he
saluted
her
therefore
and
conversed
with
her
and
then
sat
a
while
at
his
work
after
which
the
slave-girl
came
to
him
and
said
my
mistress
saluteth
thee
and
informeth
thee
that
her
husband
hath
determined
to
pass
this
next
night
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
intimate
friends
wherefore
when
he
hath
gone
thither
do
thou
come
to
herânow
the
husband347
of
the
young
woman
had
said
to
her
how
shall
we
contrive
when
he
cometh
to
thee
that
i
may
take
him
and
drag
him
before
the
wÃlee
she
replied
let
me
then
play
him
a
trick
and
involve
him
in
a
disgrace
for
which
he
shall
be
paraded
throughout
this
city
as
an
example
to
othersâand
my
brother
knew
nothing
of
the
craftiness
of
women
accordingly
at
the
approach
of
evening
the
slave-girl
came
to
him
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
returned
with
him
to
her
mistress
who
said
to
him
verily
o
my
master
i
have
been
longing
for
theeâhasten
then
said
he
to
give
me
a
kiss
first
of
all
and
his
words
were
not
finished
when
the
young
womans
husband
came
in
from
his
neighbours
house
and
seizing
my
brother
exclaimed
to
him
by
allah
i
will
not
loose
thee
but
in
the
presence
of
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
police
my
brother
humbled
himself
before
him
but
without
listening
to
him
he
took
him
to
the
house
of
the
wÃlee
who
flogged
him
with
whips
and
mounted
him
upon
a
camel
and
conveyed
him
through
the
streets
of
the
city
the
people
crying
out
this
is
the
recompense
of
him
who
breaketh
into
the
áareems
of
othersâand
he
fell
from
the
camel
and
his
leg
broke
so
he
became
lame
the
wÃlee
then
banished
him
from
the
city
and
he
went
forth
not
knowing
whither
to
turn
his
steps
but
i
though
enraged
overtook
him
and
brought
him
back
and
i
have
taken
upon
myself
to
provide
him
with
meat
and
drink
unto
the
present
day

the
khaleefeh
laughed
at
my
story
and
exclaimed
thou
hast
spoken
wellâbut
i
replied
i
will
not
accept
this
honour
until
thou
hast
listened
to
me
while
i
relate
to
thee
what
happened
to
the
rest
of
my
brothers
and
think
me
not
a
man
of
many
wordsâtell
me
said
the
khaleefeh
what
happened
to
all
thy
brothers
and
grace
my
ears
with
these
nice
particulars
i
beg
thee
to
employ
exuberance
of
diction
in
thy
relation
of
these
pleasant
tales

the
barbers
story
of
his
second
brother

so
i
said
know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
my
second
brother
whose
name
was
el-heddÃr75
was
going
one
day
to
transact
some
business
when
an
old
woman
met
him
and
said
to
him
o
man
stop
a
little
that
i
may
propose
to
thee
a
thing
which
if
it
please
thee
thou
shalt
do
for
me
my
brother
therefore
stopped
and
she
said
to
him
i
will
guide
thee
to
a
thing
and
rightly
direct
thee
to
it
on
the
condition
that
thy
words
be
not
many
so
he
said
communicate
what
thou
hast
to
tell
meâand
she
proceeded
thusâwhat
sayest
thou
of
a
handsome
house
with
running
water
and
fruit
and
wine
and
a
beautiful
face
to
behold
and
a
smooth
cheek
to
kiss
and
an
elegant
form
to
embrace
and
to
enjoy
all
these
pleasures
without
interruption
now
if
thou
wilt
act
agreeably
with
the
condition
that
i
have
imposed
upon
thee
thou
wilt
see
prosperityâwhen
my
brother
had
heard
her
words
he
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
sought
me
out
in
preference
to
all
the
rest
of
the
creation
for
this
affair
and
what
is
there
in
me
that
hath
pleased
thee
she
replied
did
i
not
say
to
thee
that
thou
must
not
be
a
person
of
many
words
be
silent
then
and
come
with
me

the
old
woman
then
went
her
way
my
brother
following
her
eager
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
which
she
had
described
to
him
until
they
had
entered
a
spacious
house
when
she
went
up
with
him
to
an
upper
story
and
my
brother
perceived
that
he
was
in
a
beautiful
palace
in349
which
he
beheld
four
damsels
than
whom
none
more
lovely
had
ever
been
seen
singing
with
voices
that
would
charm
a
heart
as
insensible
as
stone
one
of
these
damsels
drank
a
cup
of
wine
and
my
brother
said
to
her
may
it
be
attended
with
health
and
vigourâand
advanced
to
wait
upon
her
but
she
prevented
his
doing
so
giving
him
to
drink
a
cup
of
wine
and
as
soon
as
he
had
drunk
it
she
slapped
him
on
his
neck
when
he
found
that
she
treated
him
thus
he
went
out
from
the
chamber
in
anger
and
with
many
words
but
the
old
woman
following
him
made
a
sign
to
him
with
her
eye
that
he
should
return
so
he
returned
and
seated
himself
without
speaking
and
upon
this
the
damsel
slapped
him
again
upon
the
back
of
his
neck
until
he
became
senseless
after
which
recovering
he
withdrew
again
the
old
woman
however
overtook
him
and
said
to
him
wait
a
little
and
thou
shalt
attain
thy
wishâhow
many
times
said
he
shall
i
wait
a
little
before
i
attain
it
the
old
woman
answered
when
she
hath
become
exhilarated
with
wine
thou
shalt
obtain
her
favour
he
therefore
returned
to
his
place
and
resumed
his
seat
all
the
four
damsels
then
arose
and
the
old
woman
directed
them
to
divest
my
brother
of
his
outer
clothes
and
to
sprinkle
some
rose-water
upon
his
face
and
when
they
had
done
so
the
most
beautiful
one
among
them
said
to
him
may
allah
exalt
thee
to
honour
thou
hast
entered
my
abode
and
if
thou
have
patience
to
submit
to
my
requisitions
thou
wilt
attain
thy
wishâo
my
mistress
he
replied
i
am
thy
slave
and
under
thy
authorityâknow
then
said
she
that
i
am
devotedly
fond
of
frolic
and
he
who
complieth
with
my
demands
will
obtain
my
favour
then
she
ordered
the
other
damsels
to
sing
and
they
sang
so
that
their
hearers
were
in
an
ecstasy
after
which
the
chief
lady
said
to
one
of
the
other
damsels
take
thy
master
and
do
what
is
required
and
bring
him
back
to
me
immediately

accordingly
she
took
him
away
ignorant
of
that
which
she
was
about
to
do
and
the
old
woman
came
to
him
and
said
be
patient
for
there
remaineth
but
little
to
do
he
then
turned
towards
the
damsel
and
the
old
woman
said
to
him
be
patient
thou
hast
almost
succeeded
and
there
remaineth
but
one
thing
which
is
to
shave
thy
beardâhow
said
he
shall
i
do
that
which
will
disgrace
me
among
the
people
the
old
woman
answered
she
desireth
this
only
to
make
thee
like
a
beardless
youth
that
there
may
be
nothing
on
thy
face
to
prick
her
for
her
heart
is
affected
with
a
violent
love
for
thee
be
patient
therefore
and
thou
shalt
attain
thy
desireâso
my
brother
patiently
submitted
to
the
damsels
directions
his
beard
was
shaven350
and
he
was
shorn
also
of
his
eyebrows
and
mustaches
and
his
face
was
painted
red
before
the
damsel
took
him
back
to
the
chief
lady
who
when
she
saw
him
was
at
first
frightened
at
him
and
then
laughed
until
she
fell
backwards
and
exclaimed
o
my
master
thou
hast
gained
me
by
these
proofs
of
thine
amiable
manners
she
then
conjured
him
by
her
life
to
arise
and
dance
and
he
did
so
and
there
was
not
a
single
cushion
in
the
chamber
that
she
did
not
throw
at
him
in
like
manner
also
the
other
damsels
threw
at
him
various
things
such
as
oranges
and
limes
and
citrons
until
he
fell
down
senseless
from
the
pelting
while
they
slapped
him
incessantly
upon
the
back
of
his
neck
and
cast
things
in
his
face
but
at
length
the
old
woman
said
to
him
now
thou
hast
attained
thy
wish
know
that
there
remaineth
to
thee
no
more
beating
nor
doth
there
remain
for
thee
to
do
more
than
one
thing
namely
this
it
is
her
custom
when
she
is
under
the
influence
of
wine
to
suffer
no
one
to
come
near
her
until
she
hath
taken
off
her
outer
clothes
thou
being
prepared
in
the
like
manner
must
run
after
her
and
she
will
run
before
thee
as
though
she
were
flying
from
thee
but
cease
not
to
follow
her
from
place
to
place
until
thou
overtake
her
he
arose
therefore
and
did
so
the
lady
ran
before
and
as
he
followed
her
she
passed
from
chamber
to
chamber
and
he
still
ran
after
her
at
last
he
heard
her
utter
a
slight
sound
as
she
ran
before
him
and
continuing
his
pursuit
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
street

this
street
was
in
the
market
of
the
leather-sellers
who
were
then
crying
skins
for
sale
and
when
the
people
there
collected
saw
him
in
this
condition
almost
naked
with
shaven
beard
and
eyebrows
and
mustaches
and
with
his
face
painted
red
they
shouted
at
him
and
raised
a
loud
laugh
and
some
of
them
beat
him
with
the
skins
until
he
became
insensible
they
then
placed
him
upon
an
ass
and
conducted
him
to
the
wÃlee
who
exclaimed
what
is
thisâthey
answered
this
descended
upon
us
from
the
house
of
the
wezeer
in
this
condition
and
the
wÃlee
inflicted
upon
him
a
hundred
lashes
and
banished
him
from
the
city
but
i
went
out
after
him
and
brought
him
back
privately
into
the
city
and
allotted
him
a
maintenance
had
it
not
been
for
my
generous
disposition
i
had
not
borne

such

him
one
day
to
a

and
he
knocked
at
the
door
hoping
that

would

and
that

might

of

the

called

my

answered
not
and
then
heard
him
call
with
a
loud
voice
who
is
this
still
however
he
returned
him
no

and
he
heard
the
sounds
of

footsteps
approaching
until
he
came
to
the
door
and
opened

when
he
said
to
him
what

answered

for

said
the

and
my

answered
yesâthen
give
me
thy
hand
rejoined
the
master
of
the
houseâso
my
brother
stretched
forth
to
him
his
hand
and
the
man
took
him
into
the
house
and
led
him
up
from
stair-case
to
stair-case
until
he
had
ascended
to
the
highest
platform
of
the
roof
my
brother
thinking
that
he
was
going
to
give
him
some
food
or
money
and
when
he
had
arrived
at
this
highest
terrace

the

said

answered

replied

open

exclaimed
my

couldst

not
tell
me
so
when
i
was
belowâthou

of

retorted
the
other
why
didst
thou
not
ask
of
me
something
for
the
sake
of

when352
thou
heardest
my
voice
the
first
time
when
thou
wast
knocking
at
the
doorâwhat
then
said
my
brother
dost
thou
mean
to
do
to
meâthe
man
of
the
house
answered
i
have
nothing
to
give
theeâthen
take
me
down
the
stairs
said
my
brother
the
man
replied
the
way
is
before
thee
so
my
brother
made
his
way
to
the
stairs
and
continued
descending
until
there
remained
between
him
and
the
door
twenty
steps
when
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
and
rolling
down
broke
his
head77

he
went
forth
not
knowing
whither
to
direct
his
steps
and
presently
there
met
him
two
blind
men
his
companions
who
said
to
him
what
hath
happened
to
thee
this
day
my
brother
therefore
related
to
them
the
event
that
had
just
befallen
him
and
then
said
to
them
o
my
brothers
i
desire
to
take
a
portion
of
the
money
now
in
our
possession
to
expend
it
upon
myselfânow
the
owner
of
the
house
which
he
had
just
before
entered
had
followed
him
to
acquaint
himself
with
his
proceedings
and
without
my
brothers
knowledge
he
walked
behind
him
until
the
latter
entered
his
abode
when
he
went
in
after
him
still
unknown
my
brother
then
sat
waiting
for
his
companions
and
when
they
came
in
to
him
he
said
to
them
shut
the
door
and
search
the
room
lest
any
stranger
have
followed
us
when
the
intruder
therefore
heard
what
he
said
he
arose
and
clung
to
a
rope
that
was
attached
to
the
ceiling
and
the
blind
men
went
feeling
about
the
whole
of
the
chamber
and
finding
no
one
returned
and
seated
themselves
by
my
brother
and
brought
forth
their
money
and
counted
it
and
lo
it
was
more
than
ten
thousand
pieces
of
silver
having
done
this
they
laid
it
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
each
of
them
took
of
the
surplus
of
that
sum
as
much
as
he
wanted
and
they
buried
the
ten
thousand
pieces
of
silver
in
the
earth
after
which
they
placed
before
themselves
some
food
and
sat
eating
but
my
brother
heard
the
sound
of
a
stranger
by
his
side
and
said
to
his
friends
is
there
a
stranger
among
us
then
stretching
forth
his
hand
it
grasped
the
hand
of
the
intruder
whereupon
he
cried
out
to
his
companions
saying
here
is
a
strangerâand
they
fell
upon
him
with
blows
until
they
were
tired
when
they
shouted
out
o
muslims78
a
thief
hath
come
in
upon
us
and
desireth
to
take
our
propertyâand
immediately
a
number
of
persons
collected
around
them

upon
this
the
stranger
whom
they
accused
of
being
a
thief
shut
his
eyes
feigned
to
be
blind
like
themselves
so
that
no
one
who
saw
him
doubted
him
to
be
so
and
shouted
o
muslims
i
demand
protection
of
allah
and
the
suláÃn
i
demand
protection
of
allah
and353
the
wÃlee
i
demand
protection
of
allah
and
the
emeer
for
i
have
important
information
to
give
to
the
emeerâand
before
they
could
collect
their
thoughts
the
officers
of
the
wÃlee
surrounded
them
and
took
them
all
including
my
brother
and
conducted
them
before
their
master
the
wÃlee
said
what
is
your
storyâand
the
stranger
replied
hear
my
words
o
wÃlee
the
truth
of
our
case
will
not
become
known
to
thee
but
by
means
of
beating79
and
if
thou
wilt
begin
by
beating
me
before
my
companions
the
wÃlee
therefore
said
throw
down
this
man
and
flog
him
with
whipsâand
accordingly
they
threw
him
down
and
flogged
him
and
when
the
stripes
tortured
him
he
opened
one
of
his
eyes
and
after
they
had
continued
the
flogging
a
little
longer
he
opened
his
other
eye
upon
which
the
wÃlee
exclaimed
what
meaneth
this
conduct
o
thou
villainâgrant
me
indemnity
replied
the
man
and
i
will
acquaint
theeâand
the
wÃlee
having
granted
his
request
he
said
we
four
pretend
that
we
are
blind
and
intruding
among
other
people
enter
their
houses
and
see
their
women
and
employ
stratagems
to
corrupt
them
and
to
obtain
money
from
them
we
have
acquired
by
these
means
vast
gain
amounting
to
ten
thousand
pieces
of
silver
and
i
said
to
my
companions
give
me
my
due
two
thousand
and
five
hundred
and
they
rose
against
me
and
beat
me
and
took
my
property
i
beg
protection
therefore
of
allah
and
of
thee
and
thou
art
more
deserving
of
my
share
than
they
if
thou
desire
to
know
the
truth
of
that
which
i
have
said
flog
each
of
them
more
than
thou
hast
flogged
me
and
he
will
open
his
eyes

so
the
wÃlee
immediately
gave
orders
to
flog
them
and
the
first
of
them
who
suffered
was
my
brother
they
continued
beating
him
until
he
almost
died
when
the
wÃlee
said
to
them
o
ye
scoundrels
do
ye
deny
the
gracious
gift
of
god
feigning
yourselves
to
be
blind
my
brother
exclaimed
allÃh
allÃh
allÃh
there
is
none
among
us
who
seethâthey
then
threw
him
down
again
and
ceased
not
to
beat
him
until
he
became
insensible
when
the
wÃlee
said
leave
him
until
he
shall
have
recovered
and
then
give
him
a
third
floggingâand
in
the
meantime
he
gave
orders
to
flog
his
companions
to
give
each
of
them
more
than
three
hundred
stripes
while
the
seeing
man
said
to
them
open
your
eyes
or
they
will
flog
you
again
after
this
time
then
addressing
himself
to
the
wÃlee
he
said
send
with
me
some
person
to
bring
thee
the
property
for
these
men
will
not
open
their
eyes
fearing
to
be
disgraced
before
the
spectators
and
the
wÃlee
sent
with
him
a
man
who
brought
him
the
money
and
he
took
it354
and
gave
to
the
informer
out
of
it
two
thousand
and
five
hundred
pieces
of
silver
according
to
the
share
which
he
claimed
in
spite
of
the
others
retaining
the
rest
and
banished
from
the
city
my
brother
and
the
two
other
men
but
i
went
forth
o
prince
of
the
faithful
and
having
overtaken
my
brother
asked
him
respecting
his
sufferings
and
he
acquainted
me
with
that
which
i
have
related
unto
thee
i
then
brought
him
back
secretly
into
the
city
and
allotted
him
a
supply
of
food
and
drink
as
long
as
he
lived

the
khaleefeh
laughed
at
my
story
and
said
give
him
a
present
and
let
him
goâbut
i
replied
i
will
receive
nothing
until
i
have
declared
to
the
prince
of
the
faithful
what
happened
to
the
rest
of
my
brothers
and
made
it
manifest
to
him
that
i
am
a
man
of
few
wordsâwhereupon
the
khaleefeh
said
crack
our
ears
then
with
thy
ridiculous
stories
and
continue
to
us
thy
disclosure
of
vices
and
misdeeds

i
proceeded

the
barbers
story
of
his
fourth
brother

my
fourth
brother
o
prince
of
the
faithful
was
the
one-eyed
named
el-kooz
el-aáwÃnee
he
was
a
butcher
in
baghdÃd
and
both
sold
meat
and
reared
lambs
and
the
great
and
the
rich
had
recourse
to
him
to
purchase
of
him
their
meat
so
that
he
amassed
great
wealth
and
became
possessor
of
cattle
and
houses
thus
he
continued
to
prosper
for
a
long
time
and
as
he
was
in
his
shop
one
day
there
accosted
him
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
who
handed
to
him
some
money
saying
give
me
some
meat
for
it
so
he
took
the
money
and
gave
him
the
meat
and
when
the
old
man
had
gone
away
my
brother
looked
at
the
money
which
he
had
payed
him
and
seeing
that
it
was
of
a
brilliant
whiteness
put
it
aside
by
itself
this
old
man
continued
to
repair
to
him
during
a
period
of
five
months
and
my
brother
always
threw
his
money
into
a
chest
by
itself
after
which
period
he
desired
to
take
it
out
for
the
purpose
of
buying
some
sheep
but
on
opening
the
chest
he
found
all
the
contents
converted
into
white
paper
clipped
round
and
he
slapped
his
face
and
cried
out
whereupon
a
number
of
people
collected
around
him
and
he
related
to
them
his
story
at
which
they
were
astonished

he
then
went
again
as
usual
into
his
shop
and
having
killed
a
ram
and
hung
it
up
within
the
shop
he
cut
off
some
of
the
meat
and
suspended
it
outside
saying
within
himself
perhaps
now
this
old
man
will
come
again
and
if
so
i
will
seize
himâand
very
soon
after
the
old
man
approached
with
his
money
upon
which
my
brother
arose
and
laying
hold
upon
him
began
to
cry
out
o
muslims
come
to
my356
aid
and
hear
what
this
scoundrel
hath
done
unto
me
but
when
the
old
man
heard
his
words
he
said
to
him
which
will
be
more
agreeable
to
theeâthat
thou
abstain
from
disgracing
me
or
that
i
disgrace
thee
before
the
peopleâfor
what
wilt
thou
disgrace
me
said
my
brother
the
old
man
answered
for
thy
selling
human
flesh
for
muttonâthou
liest
thou
accursed
exclaimed
my
brotherânone
is
accursed
rejoined
the
old
man
but
he
who
hath
a
man
suspended
in
his
shop
my
brother
said
if
it
be
as
thou
hast
asserted
my
property
and
blood
shall
be
lawful
to
theeâand
immediately
the
old
man
exclaimed
o
ye
people
here
assembled
verily
this
butcher
slaughtereth
human
beings
and
selleth
their
flesh
for
mutton
and
if
ye
desire
to
know
the
truth
of
my
assertion
enter
his
shop
so
the
people
rushed
upon
his
shop
and
beheld
the
ram
converted
into
a
man
hung
up
and
they
laid
hold
upon
my
brother
crying
out
against
him
thou
infidel
thou
scoundrelâand
those
who
had
been
his
dearest
friends
turned
upon
him
and
beat
him
and
the
old
man
gave
him
a
blow
upon
his
eye
and
knocked
it
out
the
people
then
carried
the
carcass
and
took
with
them
my
brother
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
police
and
the
old
man
said
to
him
o
emeer
this
man
slaughtereth
human
beings
and
selleth
their
flesh
for
mutton
and
we
have
therefore
brought
him
to
thee
arise
then
and
perform
the
requisition
of
god
whose
might
and
glory
be
extolled
upon
this
the
magistrate
thrust
back
my
brother
from
him
and
refusing
to
listen
to
what
he
would
have
said
ordered
that
five
hundred
blows
of
a
staff
should
be
inflicted
upon
him
and
took
all
his
property
had
it
not
been
for
the
great
amount
of
his
wealth
he
had
put
him
to
death80
he
then
banished
him
from
the
city

my
brother
therefore
went
forth
in
a
state
of
distraction
not
knowing
what
course
to
pursue
but
he
journeyed
onwards
until
he
arrived
at
a
great
city
where
he
thought
fit
to
settle
as
a
shoemaker
so
he
opened
a
shop
and
sat
there
working
for
his
subsistence
and
one
day
he
went
forth
on
some
business
and
hearing
the
neighing
of
horses
he
inquired
respecting
the
cause
and
was
told
that
the
king
was
going
forth
to
hunt
whereupon
he
went
to
amuse
himself
with
the
sight
of
the
procession
but
the
king
happening
to
look
on
one
side
his
eye
met
that
of
my
brother
and
immediately
he
hung
down
his
head
and
exclaimed
i
seek
refuge
with
god
from
the
evil
of
this
day
he
then
turned
aside
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
rode
back
and
all
his
troops
returned
with
him
after
which
he
ordered
his
pages
to
run
after
my
brother
and
to
beat
him
and
they
did
so357
giving
him
so
severe
a
beating
that
he
almost
died
and
he
knew
not
the
cause
he
returned
to
his
abode
in
a
miserable
plight
and
afterwards
went
and
related
his
misfortune
to
one
of
the
kings
attendants
who
laughed
at
the
recital
until
he
fell
backwards
and
said
to
him
o
my
brother
the
king
cannot
endure
the
sight
of
a
one-eyed
person
and
especially
when
the
defect
is
that
of
the
left
eye81
for
in
this
case
he
faileth
not
to
put
the
person
to
death

when
my
brother
heard
these
words
he
determined
to
fly
from
that
city
and
forthwith
departed
from
it
and
repaired
to
another
city
where
there
was
no
king
here
he
remained
a
long
time
and
after
this
as
he
was
meditating
upon
his
adventure
in
the
former
city
he
went
out
one
day
to
amuse
himself
and
heard
again
the
neighing
of
horses
behind
him
upon
which
he
exclaimed
the
decree
of
god
hath
come
to
pass
and
ran
away
seeking
for
a
place
in
which
to
conceal
himself
but
he
found
none
until
continuing
his
search
he
saw
a
door
set
up
as
a
barricade
so
he
pushed
this
and
it
fell
down
and
entering
the
doorway
he
beheld
a
long
passage
into
which
he
advanced
suddenly
however
two
men
laid
hold
upon
him
and
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
enabled
us
to
take
thee
o
thou
enemy
of
god
for
these
three
nights
thou
hast
suffered
us
to
enjoy
neither
quiet
nor
sleep
and
we
have
found
no
repose
nay
thou
hast
given
us
a
foretaste
of
deathâo
men
said
my
brother
what
hath
happened
unto
you
they
answered
thou
keepest
a
watch
upon
us
and
desirest
to
disgrace
us
and
to
disgrace
the
master
of
the
house
is
it
not
enough
for
thee
that
thou
hast
reduced
him
to
poverty
thou
and
thy
companions
produce
now
the
knife
wherewith
thou
threatenest
us
every
nightâand
so
saying
they
searched
him
and
found
upon
his
waist
the
knife
with
which
he
cut
the
shoe-leatherâo
men
he
exclaimed
fear
god
in
your
treatment
of
me
and
know
that
my
story
is
wonderful
they
said
what
then
is
thy
story
so
he
related
it
to
them
in
the
hope
that
they
would
liberate
him
but
they
believed
not
what
he
said
and
instead
of
shewing
him
any
regard
they
beat
him
and
tore
his
clothes
whereupon
his
body
becoming
exposed
to
their
view
they
discovered
upon
his
sides
the
marks
of
beating
with
miáraahs
and
exclaimed
o
wretch
these
scars
bear
testimony
to
thy
guilt
they
then
conducted
him
before
the
wÃlee
while
he
said
within
himself
i
am
undone
for
my
transgressions
and
none
can
deliver
me
but
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
when
he
was
brought
before
the
wÃlee
the
magistrate
said
to
him
o
thou
scoundrel
nothing
but
a
heinous
crime
hath
occasioned
thy
having
been358
beaten
with
miáraahsâand
he
caused
a
hundred
lashes
to
be
inflicted
upon
him
after
which
they
mounted
him
upon
a
camel
and
proclaimed
before
him
this
is
the
recompense
of
him
who
breaketh
into
mens
housesâbut
i
had
already
heard
of
his
misfortunes
and
gone
forth
and
found
him
and
i
accompanied
him
about
the
city
while
they
were
making
this
proclamation
until
they
left
him
when
i
took
him
and
brought
him
back
secretly
into
baghdÃd
and
apportioned
him
a

the

story
of
his
fifth
brother82

my
fifth
brother
el-feshshÃr83
was
cropped
of
his
ears
o
prince
of
the
faithful
he
was
a
pauper
who
begged
alms
by
night
and
subsisted
upon
what
he
thus
acquired
by
day
and
our
father
was
a
very
old
man
and
he
fell
sick
and
died
leaving
to
us
seven
hundred
pieces
of
silver
of
which
each
of
us
took
his
portion
namely
a
hundred
pieces
now
my
fifth
brother
when
he
had
received
his
share
was
perplexed
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
but
while
he
was
in
this
state
it
occurred
to
his
mind
to
buy
with
it
all
kinds
of
articles
of
glass
and
to
sell
them
and
make
profit
so
he
bought
glass
with
his
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
put
it
in
a
large
tray
and
sat
upon
an
elevated
place
to
sell
it
leaning
his
back
against
a
wall
and
as
he
sat
he
meditated
and
said
within
himself
verily
my
whole
stock
consisteth
of
this
glass
i
will
sell
it
for
two
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
with
the
two
hundred
i
will
buy
other
glass
which
i
will
sell
for
four
hundred
and
thus
i
will
continue
buying
and
selling
until
i
have
acquired
great
wealth
then
with
this
i
will
purchase
all
kinds
of
merchandise
and
essences
and
jewels
and
so
obtain
vast
gain
after
that
i
will
buy
a
handsome
house
and
memlooks
and
horses
and
gilded
saddles
and
i
will
eat
and
drink
and
i
will
not
leave
in
the
city
a
single
female
singer
but
i
will
have
her
brought
to
my
house
that
i
may
hear
her
songsâall
this
he
calculated
with
the
tray
of360
glass
lying
before
himâthen
said
he
i
will
send
all
the
female
betrothers
to
seek
in
marriage
for
me
the
daughters
of
kings
and
wezeers
and
i
will
demand
as
my
wife
the
daughter
of
the
chief
wezeer84
for
i
have
heard
that
she
is
endowed
with
perfect
beauty
and
surprising
loveliness
and
i
will
give
as
her
dowry
a

fell
and

the
people
were
now
repairing
to
perform
the
friday-prayers
and
some
merely
cast
their
eyes
at
him
while
others
noticed
him
not
but
while
he
was
in
this
state
deprived
of
his
whole
property
and
weeping
without
intermission
a
female
approached
him
on
her
way
to
attend
the
friday-prayers
she
was
of
admirable
loveliness
the
odour
of
musk
was
diffused
from
her
under
her
was
a
mule
with
a
stuffed
saddle
covered
with
gold-embroidered
silk
and
with
her
was
a
number
of
servants
and
when
she
saw
the
broken
glass
and
my
brothers
state
and
his
tears
she
was
moved
with
pity
for
him
and
asked
respecting
his
case
she
was
answered
he
had
a
tray
of
glass
by
the
sale
of
which
to
obtain
his
subsistence
and
it
is
broken
and
he
is
afflicted
as
thou
seestâand
upon
this
she
called
to
one
of
the
servants
saying
give
what
thou
hast
with
thee
to
this
poor
man
so
he
gave
him
a
purse
and
he
took
it
and
when
he
had
opened
it
he
found
in
it
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
whereupon
he
almost
died
from
excessive
joy
and
offered
up
prayers
for
his
benefactress

he
returned
to
his
house
a
rich
man
and
sat
reflecting
and
lo
a
person
knocked
at
the
door
he
rose
therefore
and
opened
it
and
beheld
an
old
woman
whom
he
knew
not
and
she
said
to
him
o
my
son
know
that
the
time
of
prayer
hath
almost
expired
and
i
am
not
prepared
by
ablution
wherefore
i
beg
that
thou
wilt
admit
me
into
thy
house
that
i
may
perform
it
he
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
retiring
within
gave
her
permission
to
enter
his
mind
still
wandering
from
joy
on
account
of
the
gold
and
when
she
had
finished
the
ablution
she
approached
the
spot
where
he
was
sitting
and
there
performed
the
prayers
of
two
rekahs
she
then
offered
up
a
supplication
for
my
brother
and
he
thanked
her
and
offered
her
two
pieces
of
gold
but
when
she
saw
this
she
exclaimed
extolled
be
gods
perfection
verily
i
wonder
at
the
person
who
fell
in
love
with
thee
in
thy
beggarly
condition
take
back
thy
money
from
me
and
if
thou
want
it
not
return
it
to
her
who
gave
it
thee
when
thy
glass
brokeâo
my
mother
said
he
how
can
i
contrive
to
obtain
access
to
her
she
answered
o
my
son
she
hath
an
affection
for
thee
but
she
is
the
wife
of
an
affluent
man
take
then
with
thee
all
thy
money
and
when
thou
art
with
her
be
not
deficient
in
courteousness
and
agreeable
words
so
shalt
thou
obtain
of
her
favours
and
her
wealth
whatever
thou
shalt
desire
my
brother
therefore
took
all
the
gold
and
arose
and
went
with
the
old
woman
hardly
believing
what
she
had
told
him
and
she
proceeded
and
my
brother
behind
her
until
they
arrived
at
a
great
door
at
which
she
knocked
whereupon
a
greek
damsel365
came
and
opened
the
door
and
the
old
woman
entered
ordering
my
brother
to
do
the
same
he
did
so
and
found
himself
in
a
large
house
where
he
beheld
a
great
furnished
chamber
with
curtains
hung
in
it
and
seating
himself
there
he
put
down
the
gold
before
him
and
placed
his
turban
on
his
knees91
and
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
there
came
to
him
a
damsel
the
like
of
whom
had
never
been
seen
attired
in
most
magnificent
apparel
my
brother
stood
up
at
her
approach
and
when
she
beheld
him
she
laughed
in
his
face
and
rejoiced
at
his
visit
then
going
to
the
door
she
locked
it
after
which
she
returned
to
my
brother
and
took
his
hand
and
both
of
them
went
together
into
a
private
chamber
carpeted
with
various
kinds
of
silk
where
my
brother
sat
down
and
she
seated
herself
by
his
side
and
toyed
with
him
for
a
considerable
time
she
then
rose
saying
to
him
move
not
from
this
place
until
i
return
to
theeâand
was
absent
from
him
for
a
short
periodâand
as
my
brother
was
waiting
for
her
there
came
in
to
him
a
black
slave
of
gigantic
stature
with
a
drawn
sword
the
brightness
of
which
dazzled
the
sight
and
he
exclaimed
to
my
brother
wo
to
thee
who
brought
thee
to
this
place
thou
vilest
of
men
thou
misbegotten
wretch
and
nursling
of
impurityâmy
brother
was
unable
to
make
any
reply
his
tongue
was
instantly
tied
and
the
slave
laid
hold
upon
him
and
stripped
him
and
struck
him
more
than
eighty
blows
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
until
he
fell
sprawling
upon
the
floor
when
he
retired
from
him
concluding
that
he
was
dead
and
uttered
a
great
cry
so
that
the
earth
trembled
and
the
place
resounded
at
his
voice
saying
where
is
el-meleeáah92âupon
which
a
girl
came
to
him
holding
a
handsome
tray
containing
salt
and
with
this
she
forthwith
stuffed
the
flesh-wounds
with
which
my
brothers
skin
was
gashed
until
they
gaped
open
but
he
moved
not
fearing
the
slave
would
discover
that
he
was
alive
and
kill
him
the
girl
then
went
away
and
the
slave
uttered
another
cry
like
the
first
whereupon
the
old
woman
came
to
my
brother
and
dragging
him
by
the
feet
to
a
deep
and
dark
vault
threw
him
into
it
upon
a
heap
of
slain93
in
this
place
he
remained
for
two
whole
days
and
god
whose
perfection
be
extolled
made
the
salt
to
be
the
means
of
preserving
his
life
by
stanching
the
flow
of
blood
from
his
veins
so
when
he
found
that
he
had
strength
sufficient
to
move
he
arose
and
opening
a
shutter
in
the
wall
emerged
from
the
place
of
the
slain
and
god
to
whom
be
ascribed
all
might
and
glory
granted
him
his
protection
he
therefore
proceeded
in
the
darkness
and
concealed
himself
in
the
passage
until
the
morning
when366
the
old
woman
went
forth
to
seek
another
victim
and
my
brother
going
out
after
her
without
her
knowledge
returned
to
his
house

the
second
misfortune
of
the
barbers
fifth
brother
he
now
occupied
himself
with
the
treatment
of
his
wounds
until
he
was
restored
and
continued
to
watch
for
the
old
woman
and
constantly
saw
her
taking
men
one
after
another
and
conducting
them
to
the
same
house
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
on
the
subject
and
when
his
health
returned
and
his
strength
was
completely
renewed
he
took
a
piece
of
rag
and
made
of
it
a
purse
which
he
filled
with
pieces
of
glass
he
then
tied
it
to
his
waist
and
disguised
himself
so
that
no
one
would
know
him
in
the
dress
of
a
foreigner
and
taking
a
sword
placed
it
within
his
clothes
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
old
woman
he
said
to
her
in
the
dialect
of
a
foreigner
old
woman
hast
thou
a
pair
of
scales
fit
for
weighing
nine
hundred
pieces
of
gold
the
old
woman
answered
i
have
a
young
son
a
money-changer
and
he
hath
all
kinds
of
scales
therefore
accompany
me
to
him
before
he
go
forth
from
his
abode
that
he
may
weigh
for
thee
thy
gold
so
my
brother
said
walk
on
before
meâand
she
went
and
my
brother
followed
her
until
she
arrived
at
the
door
and
knocked
upon
which
the
girl
came
out
and
laughed
in
his
face
and
the
old
woman
said
to
her
i
have
brought
you
to-day
some
fat
meat
the
girl
then
took
my367
brothers
hand
and
conducted
him
into
the
house
the
same
which
he
had
entered
before
and
after
she
had
sat
with
him
a
short
time
she
rose
saying
to
him
quit
not
this
place
until
i
return
to
theeâand
she
retired
and
my
brother
had
remained
not
long
after
when
the
slave
came
to
him
with
the
drawn
sword
and
said
to
him
rise
thou
unlucky
so
my
brother
rose
and
as
the
slave
walked
before
him
he
put
his
hand
to
the
sword
which
was
concealed
beneath
his
clothes
and
struck
the
slave
with
it
and
cut
off
his
head
after
which
he
dragged
him
by
his
feet
to
the
vault
and
called
out
where
is
el-meleeáah
the
slave-girl
therefore
came
having
in
her
hand
the
tray
containing
the
salt
but
when
she
saw
my
brother
with
the
sword
in
his
hand
she
turned
back
and
fled
my
brother
however
overtook
her
and
struck
off
her
head
he
then
called
out
where
is
the
old
womanâand
she
came
and
he
said
to
her
dost
thou
know
me
o
malevolent
hag
she
answered
no
o
my
lordâi
am
said
he
the
man
who
had
the
pieces
of
gold
and
in
whose
house
thou
performedst
the
ablution
and
prayedst
after
which
devising
a
stratagem
against
me
thou
betrayedst
me
into
this
placeâthe
old
woman
exclaimed
fear
god
in
thy
treatment
of
meâbut
my
brother
turning
towards
her
struck
her
with
the
sword
and
clove
her
in
twain
he
then
went
to
search
for
the
chief
damsel
and
when
she
saw
him
her
reason
fled
and
she
implored
his
pardon
whereupon
he
granted
her
his
pardon
and
said
to
her
what
occasioned
thy
falling
into
the
hands
of
this
black
she
answered
i
was
a
slave
to
one
of
the
merchants
and
this
old
woman
used
to
visit
me
and
one
day
she
said
to
me
we
are
celebrating
a
festivity
the
like
of
which
no
one
hath
seen
and
i
have
a
desire
that
thou
shouldst
witness
it
i
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
arose
and
clad
myself
in
the
best
of
my
attire
and
taking
with
me
a
purse
containing
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold94
proceeded
with
her
until
she
entered
this
house
when
suddenly
this
black
took
me
and
i
have
continued
with
him
in
this
state
three
years
through
the
stratagem
of
the
old
witchâmy
brother
then
said
to
her
is
there
any
property
of
his
in
the
houseâabundance
she
answered
and
if
thou
canst
remove
it
do
soâand
upon
this
he
arose
and
went
with
her
when
she
opened
to
him
chests
filled
with
purses
at
the
sight
of
which
he
was
confounded
and
she
said
to
him
go
now
and
leave
me
here
and
bring
some
person
to
remove
the
property
so
he
went
out
and
having
hired
ten
men
returned
but
on
his
arrival
at
the
door
he
found
it
open
and
saw
neither
the
damsel
nor
the
purses
he
found
however
some
little
money
remaining
and
the
stuffs
he368
discovered
therefore
that
she
had
eluded
him
and
he
took
the
money
that
remained
and
opening
the
closets
took
all
the
stuffs
which
they
contained
leaving
nothing
in
the
house

he
passed
the
next
night
full
of
happiness
but
when
the
morning
came
he
found
at
the
door
twenty
soldiers
and
on
his
going
forth
to
them
they
laid
hold
upon
him
saying
the
wÃlee
summoneth
thee
so
they
took
him
and
conducted
him
to
the
wÃlee
who
when
he
saw
him
said
to
him
whence
obtainedst
thou
these
stuffsâgrant
me
indemnity
said
my
brotherâand
the
wÃlee
gave
him
the
handkerchief
of
indemnity95
and
my
brother
related
to
him
all
that
had
befallen
him
with
the
old
woman
from
first
to
last
and
the
flight
of
the
damsel
addingâand
of
that
which
i
have
taken
take
thou
what
thou
wilt
but
leave
me
wherewith
to
procure
my
food
the
wÃlee
thereupon
demanded
the
whole
of
the
money
and
the
stuffs
but
fearing
that
the
suláÃn96
might
become
acquainted
with
the
matter
he
retained
a
portion
only
and
gave
the
rest
to
my
brother
saying
to
him
quit
this
city
or
i
will
hang
thee
my
brother
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
went
forth
to
one
of
the
surrounding
cities
some
robbers
however
came
upon
him
and
stripped
and
beat
him
and
cut
off
his
ears
and
i
having
heard
of
his
situation
went
forth
to
him
taking
to
him
some
clothes
and
brought
him
back
privily
into
the
city
and
supplied
him
with
daily
food
and
drink

my
sixth
brother
shaáÃliá
o
prince
of
the
faithful
had
his
lips
cut
off
he
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
possessing
nothing
of
the
goods
of
this
perishable
world
and
he
went
forth
one
day
to
seek
for
something
with
which
to
stay
his
departing
spirit
and
on
his
way
he
beheld
a
handsome
house
with
a
wide
and
lofty
vestibule
at
the
door
of
which
were
servants
commanding
and
forbidding
whereupon
he
inquired
of
one
of
the
persons
standing
there
who
answered
this
house
belongeth
to
a
man
of
the
sons
of
the
barmekees97
my
brother
therefore
advanced
to
the
door-keepers
and
begged
them
to
give
him
something
and
they
said
enter
the
door
of
the
house
and
thou
wilt
obtain
what
thou
desirest
of
its
master
so
he
entered
the
vestibule
and
proceeded
through
it
a
while
until
he
arrived
at
a
mansion
of
the
utmost
beauty
and
elegance
having
a
garden
in
the
midst
of
it
unsurpassed
in
beauty
by
anything
that
had
ever
been
seen
its
floors
were
paved
with
marble
and
its
curtains
were
hanging
around
he
knew
not
in
which
direction
to
go
but
advanced
to
the
upper
extremity
and
there
he
beheld
a
man
of
handsome
countenance
and
beard
who
on
seeing
my
brother
rose
to
him
and
welcomed
him
inquiring
respecting
his
circumstances
he
accordingly
informed
him
that
he
was
in
want
and
when
the
master
of
the
house
heard
his
words
he
manifested
excessive
grief
and
taking
hold
of
his
own
clothes
rent
them
and
exclaimed
am
i
in
the
city
and
thou
in
it370
hungry
it
is
a
thing
that
i
cannot
endureâthen
promising
him
every
kind
of
happiness
he
said
thou
must
stay
and
partake
of
my
salt
but
my
brother
replied
o
my
master
i
have
not
patience
to
wait
for
i
am
in
a
state
of
extreme
hunger

upon
this
the
master
of
the
house
called
out
boy
bring
the
basin
and
ewerâand
he
said
o
my
guest
advance
and
wash
thy
hand
he
then
performed
the
same
motions
as
if
he
were
washing
his
hand
and
called
to
his
attendants
to
bring
the
table
whereupon
they
began
to
come
and
go
as
though
they
were
preparing
it
after
which
the
master
of
the
house
took
my
brother
and
sat
down
with
him
at
this
imaginary
table
and
proceeded
to
move
his
hands
and
lips
as
if
he
were
eating
saying
to
my
brother
eat
and
be
not
ashamed
for
thou
art
hungry
and
i
know
how
thou
art
suffering
from
the
violence
of
thy
hunger
my
brother
therefore
made
the
same
motions
as
if
he
also
were
eating
while
his
host
said
to
him
eat
and
observe
this
bread
and
its
whiteness
to
this
my
brother
at
first
made
no
reply
but
observed
in
his
own
mind
verily
this
is
a
man
who
loveth
to
jest
with
othersâso
he
said
to
him
o
my
master
in
my
life
i
have
never
seen
bread
more
beautifully
white
than
this
or
any
of
sweeter
tasteâon
which
the
host
rejoined
this
was
made
by
a
female
slave
of
mine
whom
i
purchased
for
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
he
then
called
out
boy
bring
to
us
the
sikbÃj98
the
like
of
which
is
not
found
among
the
dishes
of
kingsâand
addressing
my
brother
he
said
eat
o
my
guest
for
thou
art
hungry
vehemently
so
and
in
absolute
want
of
food
so
my
brother
began
to
twist
about
his
mouth
and
to
chew
as
in
eating
the
master
of
the
house
now
proceeded
to
demand
different
kinds
of
viands
one
after
another
and
though
nothing
was
brought
he
continued
ordering
my
brother
to
eat
next
he
called
out
boy
place
before
us
the
chickens
stuffed
with
pistachio-nutsâand
said
to
his
guest
eat
of
that
which
thou
hast
never
tasted
the
likeâo
my
master
replied
my
brother
verily
this
dish
hath
not
its
equal
in
sweetness
of
flavourâand
the
host
thereupon
began
to
put
his
hand
to
my
brothers
mouth
as
though
he
were
feeding
him
with
morsels
and
proceeded
to
enumerate
to
him
the
various
different
kinds
of
viands
and
to
describe
their
several
excellencies
while
his
hunger
so
increased
that
he
longed
for
a
cake
of
barley-bread
the
master
of
the
house
then
said
to
him
hast
thou
tasted
anything
more
delicious
than
the
spices
in
these
dishesâno
o
my
master
answered
my
brotherâeat
more
then
resumed
the
host
and
be
not
ashamedâi
have
eaten
enough
of
the
meats
replied
the
guest
so
the
man371
of
the
house
called
to
his
attendants
to
bring
the
sweets
and
they
moved
their
hands
about
in
the
air
as
if
they
were
bringing
them
whereupon
the
host
said
to
my
brother
eat
of
this
dish
for
it
is
excellent
and
of
these
áaáÃÃf99
by
my
life
and
take
this
one
before
the
sirup
runs
from
itâmay
i
never
be
deprived
of
thee
o
my
master
exclaimed
my
brother
proceeding
to
inquire
of
him
respecting
the
abundance
of
musk
in
the
áaáÃÃfâthis
answered
the
host
is
my
usual
custom
in
my
house
they
always
put
for
me
in
each
of
the
áaáÃÃf
a
mitháÃl100
of
musk
and
half
a
mitháÃl
of
ambergrisâall
this
time
my
brother
was
moving
his
head
and
mouth
and
rolling
about
his
tongue
between
his
cheeks
as
if
he
were
enjoying
the
sweets
after
this
the
master
of
the
house
called
out
to
his
attendants
bring
the
dried
fruitsâand
again
they
moved
about
their
hands
in
the
air
as
though
they
were
doing
what
he
ordered
when
he
said
to
my
brother
eat
of
these
almonds
and
of
these
walnuts
and
of
these
raisinsâand
so
on
enumerating
the
various
kinds
of
dried
fruits
and
added
again
eat
and
be
not
ashamedâo
my
master
replied
my
brother
i
have
had
enough
and
have
not
power
to
eat
anything
moreâbut
the
host
rejoined
if
thou
desire
o
my
guest
to
eat
more
and
to
delight
thyself
with
extraordinary
dainties
by
allah
by
allah
remain
not
hungry

my
brother
now
reflected
upon
his
situation
and
upon
the
manner
in
which
this
man
was
jesting
with
him
and
said
within
himself
by
allah
i
will
do
to
him
a
deed
that
shall
make
him
repent
before
god
of
these
actions
the
man
of
the
house
next
said
to
his
attendants
bring
us
the
wineâand
as
before
they
made
the
same
motions
with
their
hands
in
the
air
as
if
they
were
doing
what
he
commanded
after
which
he
pretended
to
hand
to
my
brother
a
cup
saying
take
this
cup
for
it
will
delight
theeâand
his
guest
replied
o
my
master
this
is
of
thy
bountyâand
he
acted
with
his
hand
as
though
he
were
drinking
itâhath
it
pleased
thee
said
the
hostâo
my
master
answered
my
brother
i
have
never
seen
anything
more
delicious
than
this
wineâdrink
then
rejoined
the
master
of
the
house
and
may
it
be
attended
with
benefit
and
healthâand
he
himself
pretended
to
drink
and
to
hand
a
second
cup
to
my
brother
who
after
he
had
affected
to
drink
it
feigned
himself
intoxicated
and
taking
his
host
unawares
raised
his
hand
until
the
whiteness
of
his
arm-pit
appeared
and
struck
him
such
a
slap
upon
his
neck
that
the
chamber
rang
at
the
blow
and
this
he
followed
by
a
second
blow
whereupon
the
man
exclaimed
what
is
this
thou
vilest
of
the
creationâo
my
master372
answered
my
brother
i
am
thy
slave
whom
thou
hast
graciously
admitted
into
thine
abode
and
thou
hast
fed
him
with
thy
provisions
and
treated
him
with
old
wine
and
he
hath
become
intoxicated
and
committed
an
outrage
upon
thee
but
thou
art
of
too
exalted
dignity
to
be
angry
with
him
for
his
ignorance

when
the
master
of
the
house
heard
these
words
of
my
brother
he
uttered
a
loud
laugh
and
said
to
him
verily
for
a
long
time
have
i
made
game
of
men
and
jested
with
all
persons
accustomed
to
joking
and
rudeness
but
i
have
not
seen
among
them
any
who
could
endure
this
trick
nor
any
who
had
sagacity
to
conform
to
all
my
actions
except
thee
now
therefore
i
pardon
thee
and
be
thou
my
companion
in
reality
and
never
relinquish
me
he
then
gave
orders
to
bring
a
number
of
the
dishes
above
mentioned
and
he
and
my
brother
ate
together
to
satisfaction
after
which
they
removed
to
the
drinking-chamber
where
female
slaves
like
so
many
moons
sang
all
kinds
of
melodies
and
played
on
all
kinds
of
musical
instruments
there
they
drank
until
intoxication
overcame
them
the
master
of
the
house
treated
my
brother
as
a
familiar
friend
became
greatly
attached
to
him
and
clad
him
with
a
costly
dress
and
on
the
following
morning
they
resumed
their
feasting
and
drinking
thus
they
continued
to
live
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
the
man
then
died
and
the
suláÃn101
seized
upon
his
property
and
took
possession
of
it

my
brother
upon
this
went
forth
from
the
city
a
fugitive
and
upon
his
way
a
party
of
arabs102
came
upon
him
they
made
him
a
captive
and
the
man
who
captured
him
tortured
him
with
beating
and
said
to
him
by
allah
purchase
thyself
of
me
by
wealth
or
i
will
kill
theeâbut
my
brother
weeping
replied
by
allah
i
possess
nothing
o
sheykh
of
the
arabs
nor
do
i
know
the
means
of
obtaining
any
property
i
am
thy
captive
i
have
fallen
into
thy
hands
and
do
with
me
what
thou
wilt
and
immediately
the
tyrannical
bedawee
drew
forth
from
his
girdle
a
broad-bladed
knife
such
as
if
plunged
into
the
neck
of
a
camel
would
cut
it
across
from
one
jugular
vein
to
the
other
and
taking
it
in
his
right
hand
approached
my
poor
brother
and
cut
off
with
it
his
lips
still
urging
his
demandânow
this
bedawee
had
a
handsome
wife
who
when
he
was
absent
used
to
manifest
a
strong
affection
for
my
brother
though
he
observed
a
proper
decorum
towards
her
fearing
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
it
happened
one
day
that
she
had
called
him
and
seated
him
with
her
but
while
they
were
together
lo
her
husband
came
in
upon
them
and
when
he
beheld
my
brother
he373
exclaimed
wo
to
thee
thou
base
wretch
dost
thou
desire
now
to
corrupt
my
wifeâthen
drawing
his
knife
he
inflicted
upon
him
another
cruel
wound
after
which
he
mounted
him
upon
a
camel
and
having
cast
him
upon
a
mountain
left
him
there
and
went
his
way
some
travellers
however
passed
by
him
and
when
they
discovered
him
they
gave
him
food
and
drink
and
acquainted
me
with
his
case
so
i
went
forth
to
him
and
conveyed
him
back
into
the
city
and
allotted
him
a
sufficient
maintenance

sixth
brother
taken
by
bedawees
now
i
have
come
unto
thee
o
prince
of
the
faithful
continued
the
barber
and
feared
to
return
to
my
house
without
relating
to
thee
these
facts
for
to
neglect
doing
so
had
been
an
error
thus
thou
hast
seen
that
although
having
six
brothers
i
am
of
a
more
upright
character
than
theyâbut
when
the
prince
of
the
faithful
had
heard
my
story
and
all
that
i
had
related
to
him
respecting
my
brothers
he
laughed
and
said
thou
hast
spoken
truth
o
áÃmit
o
silent
man
thou
art
a
person
of
few
words
and
devoid
of
impertinence
now
however
depart
from
this
city
and
take
up
thine
abode
in
another
so
he
banished
me
from
baghdÃd
and
i
journeyed
through
various
countries
and
traversed
many
regions
until
i
heard
of
his
death
and
of
the
succession
of
another
khaleefeh
when
returning
to
my
city
i
met
with
this
young
man
unto
whom
i
did
the
best
of
deeds
and
who
had
it
not
been
for
me
had
been
slain
yet
he
hath
accused
me
of
that
which
is
not
in
my
character
for
all
that
he
hath
related
of
me
with
respect
to
impertinence
and
loquacity
and
dulness
and
want
of
taste
is
false
o
people374

continuation
of
the
story
told
by
the
tailor

the
tailor
then
proceeded
thusâwhen
we
heard
the
story
of
the
barber
and
were
convinced
of
his
impertinence
and
loquacity
and
that
the
young
man
had
been
treated
unjustly
by
him
we
seized
hold
upon
him
and
put
him
in
confinement
and
seating
ourselves
to
keep
watch
over
him
ate
and
drank
and
the
feast
was
finished
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
we
remained
sitting
together
until
the
call
to
afternoon-prayers
when
i
went
forth
and
returned
to
my
house
but
my
wife
looked
angrily
at
me
and
said
thou
hast
been
all
the
day
enjoying
thy
pleasure
while
i
have
been
sitting
at
home
sorrowful
now
if
thou
go
not
forth
with
me
and
amuse
me
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
thy
refusal
will
be
the
cause
of
my
separation
from
thee
so
i
took
her
and
went
out
with
her
and
we
amused
ourselves
until
nightfall
when
returning
home
we
met
this
humpback
full
of
drink
and
repeating
verses
upon
which
i
invited
him
to
come
home
with
us
and
he
consented
i
then
went
forth
to
buy
some
fried
fish
and
having
bought
it
and
returned
we
sat
down
to
eat
and
my
wife
took
a
morsel
of
bread
and
a
piece
of
fish
and
put
them
into
his
mouth
and
choked
him
so
that
he
died
whereupon
i
took
him
up
and
contrived
to
throw
him
into
the
house
of
this
physician
and
he
contrived
to
throw
him
into
the
house
of
the
steward
and
the
steward
contrived
to
throw
him
in
the
way
of
the
brokerâthis
is
the
story
of
what
happened
to
me
yesterday
is
it
not
more
wonderful
than
that
of
the
humpback

continuation
of
the
story
of
the
humpback

when
the
king
had
heard
this
story
he
ordered
certain
of
his
chamberlains
to
go
with
the
tailor
and
to
bring
the
barber
saying
to
them
his
presence
is
indispensable
that
i
may
hear
his
talk
and
it
may
be
the
cause
of
the
deliverance
of
you
all
then
we
will
bury
this
humpback
decently
in
the
earth
for
he
hath
been
dead
since
yesterday
and
we
will
make
him
a
monument
around
his
grave
since
he
hath
been
the
occasion
of
our
acquaintance
with
these
wonderful
stories

the
chamberlains
and
the
tailor
soon
came
back
after
having
gone
to
the
place
of
confinement
and
brought
the
barber
whom
they
placed
before
the
king
and
when
the
king
beheld
him
he
saw
him
to
be
an
old
man
passed
his
ninetieth
year
of
dark
countenance
and
white
beard
and
eyebrows
with
small
ears
and
long
nose
and
a
haughty
aspect
the
king
laughed
at
the
sight
of
him
and
said
to375
him
o
silent
man
i
desire
that
thou
relate
to
me
somewhat
of
thy
storiesâo
king
of
the
age
replied
the
barber
what
is
the
occasion
of
the
presence
of
this
christian
and
this
jew
and
this
muslim
and
this
humpback
lying
dead
among
you
and
what
is
the
reason
of
this
assemblyâwherefore
dost
thou
ask
this
said
the
king
the
barber
answered
i
ask
it
in
order
that
the
king
may
know
me
to
be
no
impertinent
person
nor
one
who
meddleth
with
that
which
doth
not
concern
him
and
that
i
am
free
from
the
loquacity
of
which
they
accuse
me
for
i
am
fortunate
in
my
characteristic
appellation
since
they
have
surnamed
me
eá-áÃmit
and
as
the
poet
hath
saidâ

seldom
hast
thou
seen
a
person
honoured
with
a
surname
but
thou
wilt
find
if
thou
search
that
his
character
is
expressed
by
it

the
king
therefore
said
explain
to
the
barber
the
case
of
this
humpback
and
what
happened
to
him
yesterday
evening
and
explain
to
him
also
what
the
christian
hath
related
and
the
jew
and
the
steward
and
the
tailor
so
they
repeated
to
him
the
stories
of
all
these
persons

the
barber
thereupon
shook
his
head
saying
by
allah
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
uncover
this
humpback
that
i
may
examine
himâand
they
did
so
he
then
seated
himself
at
his
head
and
taking
it
up
placed
it
upon
his
lap
and
looked
at
his
face
and
laughed
so
violently
that
he
fell
backwards
exclaiming
for
every
death
there
is
a
cause
and
the
death
of
this
humpback
is
most
wonderful
it
is
worthy
of
being
registered
in
the
records
that
posterity
may
be
instructed
by
this
eventâthe
king
astonished
at
his
words
said
o
áÃmit
explain
to
us
the
reason
of
thy
saying
thisâo
king
replied
the
barber
by
thy
beneficence
life
is
yet
in
the
humpback
he
then
drew
forth
from
his
bosom
a
pot
containing
some
ointment
and
with
this
he
anointed
the
neck
of
the
humpback
after
which
he
covered
it
up
until
it
perspired
when
he
took
forth
an
iron
forceps
and
put
it
down
his
throat
and
extracted
the
piece
of
fish
with
its
bone
and
all
the
people
saw
them
the
humpback
now
sprang
upon
his
feet
and
sneezed
and
recovering
his
consciousness
drew
his
hands
over
his
face
and
exclaimed
there
is
no
deity
but
god
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
god
bless
and
save
himâand
all
who
were
present
were
astonished
at
the
sight
and
the
king
laughed
until
he
became
insensible
as
did
also
the
other
spectators
the
king
exclaimed
by
allah
this
accident
is
wonderful
i
have
never
witnessed
anything
more
strangeâand
added
o
muslims
o
assembly
of
soldiers
have
ye
ever
in
the
course
of
your
lives
seen
any376
one
die
and
after
that
come
to
life
but
had
not
god
blessed
him
with
this
barber
the
humpback
had
been
to-day
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
other
world
for
the
barber
hath
been
the
means
of
restoring
him
to
lifeâthey
replied
this
is
indeed
a
wonderful
thing

the
king
then
gave
orders
to
record
this
event
and
when
they
had
done
so
he
placed
the
record
in
the
royal
library
and
he
bestowed
dresses
of
honour
upon
the
jew
and
the
christian
and
the
steward
upon
each
of
them
a
costly
dress
the
tailor
he
appointed
to
be
his
own
tailor
granting
him
regular
allowances
and
reconciling
him
and
the
humpback
with
each
other
the
humpback
he
honoured
with
a
rich
and
beautiful
dress
and
with
similar
allowances
and
appointed
him
his
cup-companion
and
upon
the
barber
also
he
conferred
the
like
favours
rewarding
him
with
a
costly
dress
of
honour
regular
allowances
and
a
fixed
salary
and
appointing
him
state-barber
and
his
own
cup-companion
so
they
all
lived
in
the
utmost
happiness
and
comfort
until
they
were
visited
by
the
terminator
of
delights
and
the
separator
of
friends

as
the
story
of
the
humpback
is
one
of
the
best
in

and
purely
arab
i
have
been
glad
to
find
in
the
calcutta

of
the

hundred
nights
authority
for
deviating
here
from
my
usual
standard
copy
by
substituting
el-baárah
for
a
city
of

the

lays
the
scene
at

destroyed

doubted
in
his
mind
by
what
means
god
could
raise
the
city
and
its
inhabitants
again
whereupon
god
caused
him
to
die
and
he
remained
in
that
condition
a
hundred
years
at
the
end
of
which
god
restored
him
to
life

he
found
a

he
had
with
him
not
in

spoiled

was
dead

bones
only
remaining

these
while

were
raised

most
arab
cities
abound
with
cats
which
are
much
favoured
by
the
inhabitants
these
animals
are
often
seen
leaping
across
from
the
terrace
of
one
house
to
that
of
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
narrow
street
and
often
has
my

been
robbed

to
contribute
greatly

occurrences
of
this
kind
are
said
to
have
often
happened
in
arab
towns
where
dogs
though
esteemed
unclean
by
the
muslims
are
like
cats
generally
very
numerous
few
of
them
have
masters
but
they
compose
distinct
tribes
those
of
each
tribe
confining
themselves
to
a
particular
quarter
or
district
of
the
town
and
suffering
no
strange
dog
to
intrude
among
them
and
share
with
them
in
the
offal
thrown
out
from
the
butchers
shops
and
from
private
houses
or
prowling
about
the
mounds
of
rubbish
in
the
environs
and
like
the
vultures
feeding
upon
the
carcasses
of
camels
asses
and
other
beasts
thrown
out

was
once
told

fallen
asleep

the
snatching

very
lucrative

is
there

one
of
the
passages
in

is
the
name
now
applied
to
a
portion

street
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
lake
called
birket
el-feel
in
the
southern
part
of

it
is
evidently
thus
applied
in
the
passage
to
which
this
note
relates
but
el-maáreezee
writing
in
the
former
half
of
the
ninth
century
of
the
flight330
says
in
this
our
time
bordering
upon
it
the
birket
el-feel
is
a
garden
called
by
the
name
of
the
áabbÃneeyeh
who
were
a
family
of
darmÃ

son

the

darmÃ

was

the

áeiyi

the
áabbÃneeyoon
or
áabbÃneeyehâfor
the
terms
are
synonymous
were
a
family
of
darmÃ

and
the
people
have
made
a
road
between
the
garden
of
the
áabbÃneeyeh
and
the
lake
he
proceeds
to
say
that
on
the
east
of
the
birket
el-feel
there
were
gardens
but
that
houses
and
streets
had
been
built
thereânow
in
the
work
before
us
the
tract
which
was
a
garden
in
the

of
el-maáreezee
is
mentioned
as
occupied
by
houses
and
streets
many
years
must
have
elapsed
since
that
period
before
such
could
have
been
the
case
and
surely
at
least
a
century
before
the
houses
could
have
presented
such
an
appearance
as
would
lead
a
writer
to
imagine
them
of
ancient
times
it
may
be
objected
against
an
argument
drawn
from
this
passage
that
it
is
perhaps
an
interpolation
of
a
copyist
but
it
agrees
with
many
evidences
of
a
late
date
and
occurs
in
at
least
one
other
copy
that
from
which
the
breslau
edition
is
printed
with
only
this
slight
differenceâthat
áabbÃneeyeh
by
the
erroneous
addition
of
a
point
beneath
the
first
letter
is
converted
into
jebbÃneeyeh
and
it
should
be
remarked
that
the
latter
copy
varies
considerably
in
other
points
from
that
of
cairo
it
would
imply
that
cairo
was
almost
as
extensive
a
city
at
the
time
when
this

was
composed
or
modernized
as
it
is

would
account
for
its
being

called

was
retained
by

as
late
as

steals
an
article

value
of
a
quarter

which
he
has
not
ordinary
or
free
access
shall
lose
his
right
hand

this
punishment
is
not
to
be
inflicted
for
stealing
a
free
child
or
anything
which
in
the
eye
of
the
law
is
of
no
pecuniary
value
as
wine
or
a
musical
instrument
and
there
are
some
other
cases
in
which
the
thief
is
not
to
be
so
punished

hurried
manner

have
assembled
each
of
them

in

augurations
with

this
passage
alludes
to
an
astrological
calculation
made
with
the
view
of
determining
by
what
sign
of
the
zodiac
the
two
persons
are
influenced
who
contemplate
becoming
man
and
wife
and
thence
ascertaining
whether
they
will
agree
this
is
often
done
in
the
present
day
by
adding
together
the
numerical
values
of
the
letters
composing
his
or
her
name
and
that
of
the
mother
and
if
i
remember
right
subtracting
from
12
the
whole
sum
if
this
is
less
than
12
or
what
remains
after
subtracting
or
dividing
by
12
thus
is
obtained
the
number
of
the
sign
the
twelve
signs
commencing
with
aries
correspond
respectively
with
the
elements
of
fire
earth
air
water
fire
earth
and
so
on
and
if
the
signs
of
the
two
parties
indicate
the
same
element
it
is
inferred
that
they
will
agree
but
if
they
indicate
different
elements
the
inference
is
that
the
one
will
be
affected
by
the
other
in
the
same
manner
as
the
element
of
the
one
is
by
that
of
the
other
thus
if
the
element
of
the
man
is
fire
and
that
of
the
woman
water
he
will
be
subject
to
her
rule

among
other
calculations
of

kind

following
which
my

mentioned
in

numerical
values

name
of
each

two
parties
are
added
together
and
one
of
these
two
sums
is
subtracted
from
the
other
if
the
remainder
is
an
uneven
number
the
inference
is
unfavourable
but
if
even
the
reverse

in
the
present
instance
the
dupe
knowing
that
there
are
various
modes
of
divining
whether
he
will
be
happy
with
his
wife
is
made
to
believe
that
his
fortune
depends
upon
the
mode
instead
of
the
result
of
the
calculation

notorious

their
impudenceâit
is
related
that
moses
while
bathing
one
day
in
the
nile
saw
a
blind
man
pass
by
and
being
moved
with
pity
prayed
that
god
would
restore
his
sight
his
prayer
was
answered
but
as
soon
as
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
were
opened
he
seized
the
clothes
of
his
benefactor
which
were
lying
on
the
bank
and
protested
that
they
were
his
own
moses
therefore
now
prayed
that
the
thief
might
be
struck
blind
again
and
god
answering
his
prayer
said
o
moses
know
that
i
am
wiser
than
thou
with
respect
to
my
creaturesâthis
tradition
was
related
to
me

their
obstinacy

well

often
heard
to
boast
of
the

they
have
received

one

with
his

on
the
difficulties
experienced
in
the
exercise

one
of
the
company
remarked
in
my
opinion
the
greatest
difficulty
that
is
met
with
is
when
one
of
the
parties
is
rich
and
the
other
poorâin

case

i

none
for
it
is
clear
that
the
rich
will
gain
his
cause
and
the
poor
will
lose
but
the
great
difficulty
is
when
the
two
parties
are
equally
rich
and
powerful
if
thou
he
continued
being
a
poor
man
have
a
suit
against
one
who
is
rich
and
powerful
beware
of
applying
to
the
áÃáee
for
he
will
not
fail
to
condemn
thee
my
advice
is
that
thou
desist
altogether
from
thy
suit
and
rather
throw
thyself
at
the
feet
of
thine
adversary
for
thou
wilt
obtain
more
justice
from
him

from

remarks
in

that
this
part
of
the
barbers
story
of
his
fifth
brother
is
derived
from
an
indian
fable
of
the
remotest
antiquity

found
in
the
heeto-pades
of
veeshnoo-sarma
in
which
a
brahman
inadvertently
breaks
his
pottery
ware

with
a
walking-stick

act
of
suppressing
the
outrageous
jealousy
of
four
beautiful

i
have
substituted
this
name
for
el-ashshÃr
the
reading
in
my
original
in
the
arabic
characters
the
latter
differs
from
the
former
in
little
more
than
the
want
of
a
point
and
has
no
appropriate
meaning
it
appears
that
in
most
copies
of
the
original
the
barbers
fifth
brother
is
surnamed
en-neshshÃr
or
the
sawyer
perhaps
in
allusion
to
his
incessant
loquacity
but
this
also
in
the
arabic
characters
very
nearly
resembles
el-feshshÃr
which
i
doubt
not
to
be
the
right
name

is
nothing
very
extravagant
in
this
hope
of

for

persons
frequently
rise
from
very
low
to
very
high
stations

it
is
remarkable
that
notwithstanding
their
usual
pride
they
generally
retain
the
appellation
of
the

which
they
or

fathers
pursued

ignoble
before

it
is

himself

the

an
occurrence
of
a
similar
nature
which
happened
a
few
years
ago
in
cairo
was
related
to
me
by
one
of
my
friends
thereâan
old
woman
frequented
the
tomb
of
a
saint
in
that
city
near
the
eastern
gate
called
the
bÃb
el-maárooá
to
which
many
women
afflicted
with
disease
or
barrenness
often
resorted
to
offer
up
prayers
believing
their
petitions
would
be
effectual
through
the
saints
intercession
and
she
was
in
the
habit
of
enticing
ladies
from
this
tomb
to
the
house
of
her
husband
which
was
near
by
under
pretence
of
his
serving
them
with
medicines
or
with
charms
the
unsuspecting
victim
being
desired
to
go
thither
alone
was
conducted
by
the
old
woman
to
an
upper
room
at
the
end
of
which
the
man
was
seated
and
in
walking
over
the
matted
floor
to
approach
him
suddenly
fell
through
a
trap-door
into
a
place
so
deep
that
the
fall
rendered
her
senseless
in
this
state
she
was
put
to
death
and
as
ladies
in
cairo
always
wear
valuable
ornaments
and
costly
clothes
the
murderers
were
sure
of
obtaining
considerable
spoil

note

the

there
was
in
el-baárah
a
certain
king
who
loved
the
poor
and
indigent
and
regarded
his
subjects
with
benevolence
he
bestowed
of
his
wealth
upon
him
who
believed
in
moáammad
god
bless
and
save
him
and
was
such
as
one
of
the
poets
who
have
written
of
him
hath
thus
describedâ

he
used
his
lances
as
pens
and
the
hearts
of
his
enemies
as
paper
their
blood
being
his
ink
and
hence
i
imagine
our
forefathers
applied
to
the
lance
the
term
khaááeeyeh2
391
the
name
of
this
king
was
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn

and
he
had
two
wezeers
one
of
whom
was

that
all
hearts
agreed
in
loving
him
and
the
wise
complied
with
his
counsel
and
all
the
people
supplicated
for
him
length
of
life
for
he
was
a
person
of
auspicious
aspect5
a
preventer
of
evil
and
mischief
but
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
hated
others
and
loved
not
good
he
was
a
man
of
inauspicious
aspect
and
in
the
same
degree
that
the
people
loved
faál-ed-deen
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
so
did
they
abhor
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
in
accordance
with
the
decree
of
the
almighty

now
the
king
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn
ez-zeynee
was
sitting
one
day
upon
his
throne
surrounded
by
the
officers
of
his
court
and
he
called
to
his
wezeer
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
said
to
him
i
desire
a
female
slave
unsurpassed
in
beauty
by
any
in
her
age
of
perfect
loveliness
and
exquisite
symmetry
and
endowed
with
all
praiseworthy
qualitiesâsuch
as
this
replied
his
courtiers
is
not
to
be
found
for
less
than
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
the
suláÃn
thereupon
called
out
to
the
treasurer
saying
carry
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
to
the
house
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
so
the
treasurer
did
as
he
commanded
and
the
wezeer
departed
after
the
suláÃn
had
ordered
him
to
repair
every
day
to
the
market
and
to
commission
the
brokers
to
procure
what
he
had
described
and
had
commanded
also
that
no
female
slave
of
a
greater
price
than
one
thousand
pieces
of
gold
should
be
sold
without
having
been
shewn
to
the
wezeer

the
brokers
therefore
sold
no
female
slave
without
shewing
her
to
him
and
he
complied
with
the
kings
command
and
thus
he
continued
to
do
for
a
considerable
time
no
slave
pleasing
him
but
on
a
certain
day
one
of
the
brokers
came
to
the
mansion
of
the
wezeer
el-faál
and
found
that
he
had
mounted
to
repair
to
the
palace
of
the
king
and
he
laid
hold
upon
his
stirrup
and
repeated
these
two
versesâ

o
thou
who
hast
reanimated
what
was
rotten
in
the
state
thou
art
the
wezeer
ever
aided
by
heaven
thou
hast
revived
the
noble
qualities
that
were
extinct
among
men
may
thy
conduct
never
cease
to
be
approved
by
god
he
then
said
o
my
master
the
female
slave
for
the
procuring
of392
whom
the
noble
mandate
was
issued
hath
arrived
the
wezeer
replied
bring
her
hither
to
me
so
the
man
returned
and
after
a
short
absence
came
again
accompanied
by
a
damsel
of
elegant
stature
high-bosomed
with
black
eyelashes
and
smooth
cheek
and
slender
waist
and
large
hips
clad
in
the
handsomest
apparel
the
moisture
of
her
lips
was
sweeter
than
sirup
her
figure
put
to
shame
the
branches
of
the
oriental
willow
and
her
speech
was
more
soft
than
the
zephyr
passing
over
the
flowers
of
the
garden
as
one
of
her
describers
hath
thus
expressedâ

her
skin
is
like
silk
and
her
speech
is
soft
neither
redundant
nor
deficient
her
eyes
god
said
to
them
beâand
they
were
affecting
mens
hearts
with
the
potency
of
wine
may
my
love
for
her
grow
more
warm
each
night
and
cease
not
until
the
day
of
judgment
the
locks
on
her
brow
are
dark
as
night
while
her
forehead
shines
like
the
gleam
of
morning
when
the
wezeer
beheld
her
she
pleased
him
extremely
and
he
looked
towards
the
broker
and
said
to
him
what
is
the
price
of
this
damsel
the
broker
answered
the
price
bidden
for
her
hath
amounted
to
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
her
owner
hath
sworn
that
this
sum
doth
not
equal
the
cost
of
the
chickens
which
she
hath
eaten
nor
the
cost
of
the
dresses
which
she
hath
bestowed
upon
her
teachers
for
she
hath
learnt
writing
and
grammar
and
lexicology
and
the
interpretation
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
the
fundamentals
of
law
and
religion
and
medicine
and
the
computation
of
the
calendar
and
the
art
of
playing
upon
musical
instruments
the
wezeer
then
said
bring
to
me
her
masterâand
the
broker
immediately
brought
him
and
lo
he
was
a
foreigner
who
had
lived
so
long
that
time
had
reduced
him
to
bones
and
skin
as
the
poet
hath
saidâ

how
hath
time
made
me
to
tremble
for
time
is
powerful
and
severe
i
used
to
walk
without
being
weary
but
now
i
am
weary
and
do
not
walk
and
the
wezeer
said
to
him
art
thou
content
to
receive
for
this
damsel
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
from
the
suláÃn
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn
ez-zeynee
the
foreigner
answered
as
she
is
for
the
suláÃn
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
give
her
as
a
present
to
him
without
price6
so
the
wezeer
upon
this
ordered
that
the
money
should
be
brought
and
then
weighed
the
pieces
of
gold
for
the
foreigner
after
which
the
slave-broker
addressed
the
wezeer
and
said
with
the
permission
of
our
lord
the
wezeer
i
will
speakâimpart
what
thou
hast
to
say
replied
the
wezeerâit
is
my
opinion
then
said
the
broker
that
thou
shouldst
not
take
up
this393
damsel
to
the
suláÃn
to-day
for
she
hath
just
arrived
from
her
journey
and
the
change
of
air
hath
affected
her
and
the
journey
hath
fatigued
her
but
rather
let
her
remain
with
thee
in
thy
palace
ten
days
that
she
may
take
rest
and
her
beauty
will
improve
then
cause
her
to
be
taken
into
the
bath
and
attire
her
in
clothes
of
the
handsomest
description
and
go
up
with
her
to
the
suláÃn
so
shalt
thou
experience
more
abundant
good
fortune
and
the
wezeer
considered
the
advice
of
the
slave-broker
and
approved
it
he
therefore
took
her
into
his
palace
and
gave
her
a
private
apartment
to
herself
allotting
her
every
day
what
she
required
of
food
and
drink
and
other
supplies
and
she
continued
a
while
in
this
state
of
enjoyment

noor-ed-deen
embracing
the
slave
now
the
wezeer
el-faál
had
a
son
like
the
shining
full
moon
with
brilliant
countenance
and
red
cheek
marked
with
a
mole
like
a
globule
of
ambergris
and
with
grey
down
the
youth
knew
not
of
this
damsel
and
his
father
had
charged
her
saying
know
that
i
have
purchased
thee
for
the
king
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn
ez-zeynee
and
that
i
have
a
son
who
hath
not
left
a
girl
in
the
quarter
without
making
love
to
her
therefore
keep
thyself
concealed
from
him
and
beware
of
shewing
him
thy
face
or
suffering
him
to
hear
thy
voice
the
damsel
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
left
her
and
departed
and
it
happened
as
fate
had
ordained
that
she
went
one
day
into
the
bath
which
was
in
the
house
and
after
certain
of
the
female
slaves
had
bathed
her
she
attired
herself
in
rich
apparel
and
her
beauty
and
loveliness
increased
in
consequence
she
then
went
in
to
the
wezeers
wife
and
kissed
her
hand
and
she
said
to
her
may
it
be
favourable7
o
enees-el-jelees
how
didst
thou
find
this
bathâo
my
mistress
she
answered
i
wanted
nothing
but
thy
presence
there
and
upon
this
the
mistress
of
the
house
said
to
the
female
slaves
arise
and
let
us
go
into
the
bath
and
they
complied
with
her
command
and
went
accompanied
by
their
mistress
who
first
charged
two
young
slave-girls
to
keep
the
door
of
the
private
apartment
in
which
was
enees-el-jelees
saying
to
them
suffer
no
one
to
go
in
to
the
damselâand
they
replied
we
hear
and
obey
but
while
enees-el-jelees
was
sitting
in
her
chamber
lo
the
wezeers
son
whose
name
was
alee
noor-ed-deen
came
in
and
asked
after
his
mother
and
the
family
the
two
girls
answered
they
are
gone
into
the
bath
now
the
damsel
enees-el-jelees
heard
the
speech
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
as
she
sat
in
her
chamber
and
she
said
within
herself
i
wonder
what
this
youth
is
like
of
whom
the
wezeer394
hath
told
me
that
he
hath
not
left
a
girl
in
the
quarter
without
making
love
to
her
by
allah
i
have
a
desire
to
see
him
she
then
rose
upon
her
feet
fresh
as
she
was
from
the
bath
and
approaching
the
door
of
the
chamber
looked
at
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
beheld
him
to
be
a
youth
like
the
full
moon
the
sight
of
him
occasioned
her
a
thousand
sighs
and
a
look
from
the
youth
at
her
affected
him
also
in
the
same
manner
each
was
caught
in
the
snare
of
the
others
love
and
the
youth
approached
the
two
slave-girls
and
cried
out
at
them
whereupon
they
fled
from
before
him
and
stopped
at
a
distance
looking
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
then
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
opening
it
went
in
and
said
to
the
damsel
art
thou
she
whom
my
father
hath
purchased
for
me
she
answered
yes
and
upon
this
the
youth
who
was
in
a
state
of
intoxication
went
up
to
her
and
embraced
her
while
she
in
like
manner
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
but
the
two
slave-girls
having
seen
their
young
master
enter
the
chamber
of
the
damsel
enees-el-jelees
cried
out
the
youth
therefore
soon
ran
forth
and
fled
for
safety
fearing
the
consequence
of
his
intrusion
and
when
the
mistress
of
the
house
heard
the
cry
of
the
two
slave-girls
she
came
out
dripping
from
the
bath
saying
what
is
the
cause
of
this
cry
in
the395
house
and
when
she
drew
near
to
the
two
slave-girls
whom
she
had
placed
at
the
door
of
the
private
chamber
she
said
to
them
wo
to
you
what
is
the
matterâthey
answered
as
soon
as
they
beheld
her
our
master
alee
noor-ed-deen
came
to
us
and
beat
us
and
we
fled
from
him
and
he
went
into
the
chamber
of
enees-el-jelees
and
when
we
cried
out
to
thee
he
fled
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
went
to
enees-el-jelees
and
said
to
her
what
is
the
newsâo
my
mistress
she
answered
as
i
was
sitting
here
a
youth
of
handsome
person
came
in
to
me
and
said
to
me
art
thou
she
whom
my
father
hath
purchased
for
meâand
i
answered
yesâby
allah
o
my
mistress
i
believed
that
what
he
said
was
true
and
he
came
up
to
me
and
embraced
me
and
kissed
me
three
times
and
he
left
me
overcome
by
his
love

upon
this
the
mistress
of
the
house
wept
and
slapped
her
face
and
her
female
slaves
did
the
like
fearing
for
alee
noor-ed-deen
lest
his
father
should
slay
him
and
while
they
were
in
this
state
lo
the
wezeer
came
in
and
inquired
what
had
happened
his
wife
said
to
him
swear
that
thou
wilt
listen
to
that
which
i
shall
say
he
replied
well
so
she
told
him
what
his
son
had
done
and
he
mourned
and
rent
his
clothes
and
slapped
his
face
and
plucked
his
beard
his
wife
then
said
to
him
kill
not
thyself
i
will
give
thee
of
my
own
property
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
her
priceâbut
upon
this
he
raised
his
head
towards
her
and
said
to
her
wo
to
thee
i
want
not
her
price
but
i
fear
the
loss
of
my
life
and
my
propertyâwherefore
o
my
master
she
askedâknowest
thou
not
said
he
that
we
have
this
enemy
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
when
he
heareth
of
this
event
he
will
repair
to
the
suláÃn
and
say
to
him
thy
wezeer
whom
thou
imaginest
to
love
thee
hath
received
from
thee
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
purchased
therewith
a
female
slave
such
as
no
one
hath
seen
equalled
and
when
she
pleased
him
he
said
to
his
son
take
her
for
thou
art
more
worthy
of
her
than
the
suláÃnâand
he
took
her
and
the
damsel
is
now
with
himâthen
the
king
will
say
thou
liest
and
he
will
say
to
the
king
with
thy
permission
i
will
break
in
upon
him
suddenly
and
bring
her
to
thee
and
he
will
give
him
permission
to
do
so
he
will
therefore
make
a
sudden
attack
upon
the
house
and
take
the
damsel
and
conduct
her
into
the
presence
of
the
suláÃn
and
he
will
question
her
and
she
will
not
be
able
to
deny
he
will
then
say
o
my
lord
i
give
thee
good
counsel
but
i
am
not
in
favour
with
theeâand
the
suláÃn
will
make
an
example
of
me
and
all
the
people
will
make
me
a
gazing-stock
and396
my
life
will
be
lostâhis
wife
however
replied
acquaint
no
one
for
this
thing
hath
happened
privily
commit
therefore
thine
affair
unto
god
in
this
extremity
and
upon
this
the
heart
of
the
wezeer
was
quieted
and
his
mind
was
relieved

such
was
the
case
of
the
wezeerânow
as
to
noor-ed-deen
he
feared
the
result
of
his
conduct
and
so
passed
each
day
in
the
gardens
not
returning
to
his
mother
until
towards
the
close
of
the
night
he
then
slept
in
her
apartment
and
rose
before
morning
without
being
seen
by
any
one
else
thus
he
continued
to
do
so
for
the
space
of
a
month
not
seeing
the
face
of
his
father
and
at
length
his
mother
said
to
his
father
o
my
master
wilt
thou
lose
the
damsel
and
lose
the
child
for
if
it
long
continue
thus
with
the
youth
he
will
flee
his
countryâand
what
is
to
be
done
said
he
she
answered
sit
up
this
night
and
when
he
cometh
lay
hold
upon
him
and
be
reconciled
to
him
and
give
him
the
damsel
for
she
loveth
him
and
he
loveth
her
and
i
will
give
thee
her
price
so
the
wezeer
sat
up
the
whole
night
and
when
his
son
came
he
laid
hold
upon
him
and
would
have
cut
his
throat8
but
his
mother
came
to
his
succour
and
said
to
her
husband
what
dost
thou
desire
to
do
unto
him
he
answered
her
i
desire
to
slay
him
the
youth
then
said
to
his
father
am
i
of
so
small
account
in
thy
estimation
and
upon
this
the
eyes
of
his
father
filled
with
tears
and
he
said
to
him
o
my
son
is
the
loss
of
my
property
and
my
life
of
small
account
with
theeâlisten
o
my
father
rejoined
the
youthâand
he
implored
his
forgiveness
so
the
wezeer
rose
from
the
breast
of
his
son
and
was
moved
with
compassion
for
him
and
the
youth
rose
and
kissed
his
fathers
hand
and
the
wezeer
said
o
my
son
if
i
knew
that
thou
wouldst
act
equitably
to
enees-el-jelees
i
would
give
her
to
theeâo
my
father
replied
the
youth
wherefore
should
i
not
act
equitably
towards
her
and
his
father
said
i
charge
thee
o
my
son
that
thou
take
not
a
wife
to
share
her
place
and
that
thou
do
her
no
injury
nor
sell
her
he
replied
o
my
father
i
swear
to
thee
that
i
will
neither
take
a
wife
to
share
her
place
nor
sell
herâand
he
promised
him
by
oaths
to
act
as
he
had
said
and
took
up
his
abode
with
the
damsel
and
remained
with
her
a
year
and
god
whose
name
be
exalted
caused
the
king
to
forget
the
affair
of
the
female
slave
but
the
matter
became
known
to
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
yet
he
could
not
speak
of
it
on
account
of
the
high
estimation
in
which
the
other
wezeer
was
held
by
the
suláÃn

after
this
year
had
expired

entered
the
oath
and
came
out
in
a
state
of
excessive
perspiration
in
consequence
of
which
the
external
air
smote
him
so
that
he
became
confined
to
his
bed
and
long
remained
sleepless
and
his
malady
continued
unremittingly
so
he
called
thereupon
his
son
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
when
he
came
before
him
said
to
him
o
my
son
verily
the
means
of
life
are
apportioned
and
its
period
is
decreed
and
every
soul
must
drink
the
cup
of
death
i
have
nothing
with
which
to
charge
thee
but
the
fear
of
god
and
forethought
with
regard
to
the
results
of
thine
actions
and
that
thou
conduct
thyself
kindly
to
the
damsel
enees-el-jeleesâo
my
father
said
the
youth
who
is
like
unto
thee
thou
hast
been
celebrated
for
virtuous
actions
and
the
praying
of
the
preachers
for
thee
on
the
pulpitsâo
my
son
rejoined
the
wezeer
i
hope
for
the
approbation
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
then
he
pronounced
the
two
professions
of
the
faith9
and
uttered
a
sigh
and
was
recorded
among
the
company
of
the
blest
and
upon
this
the
palace
was
filled
with
shrieking
and
the
news
reached
the
ears
of
the
suláÃn
and
the
people
of
the
city
heard
of
the
death
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
even
the
boys
in
the
schools
wept
for
him10
his
son
alee
noor-ed-deen
arose
and
prepared
his
funeral
and
the
emeers
and
wezeers
and
other
officers
of
the
state
attended
it
and
among
them
was
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
and
as
the
procession
passed
out
from
the
mansion
one
of
the
mourners
recited
these
versesâ

i
said
to
the
man
who
was
appointed
to
wash
himâwould
that
he
had
yielded
obedience
to
my
counselâ
put
away
from
him
the
water
and
wash
him
with
the
tears
of
honour
shed
in
lamentation
for
him
398
and
remove
these
fragrant
substances
collected
for
his
corpse
and
perfume
him
rather
with
the
odours
of
his
praise
and
order
the
noble
angels
to
carry
him
in
honour
dost
thou
not
behold
them
attending
him
cause
not
mens
necks
to
be
strained
by
bearing
him
enough
are
they
laden
already
by
his
benefits11
alee
noor-ed-deen
for
a
long
time
remained
in
a
state
of
violent
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
father
but
as
he
was
sitting
one
day
in
his
fathers
house
a
person
knocked
at
the
door
and
he
rose
up
and
opened
it
and
lo
there
was
a
man
who
was
one
of
his
fathers
intimate
companions
and
he
kissed
the
hand
of
noor-ed-deen
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
he
who
hath
left
a
son
like
thee
hath
not
died
this
is
the
destination
of
the
lord
of
the
first
and
the
last
among
mankind12
o
my
master
cheer
up
thy
heart
and
give
over
mourningâand
upon
this
alee
noor-ed-deen
arose
and
went
to
the
guest-chamber
and
removed
thither
all
that
he
required
and
his
companions
came
together
to
him
and
he
took
again
his
slave
ten
of
the
sons
of
the
merchants
became
his
associates
and
he
gave
entertainment
after
entertainment
and
began
to
be
lavish
with
presents
his
steward
therefore
came
in
to
him
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
noor-ed-deen
hast
thou
not
heard
the
saying
he
who
expendeth
and
doth
not
calculate
is
reduced
to
poverty
this
profuse
expenditure
and
these
magnificent
presents
will
annihilate
the
propertyâbut
when
alee
noor-ed-deen
heard
these
words
of
his
steward
he
looked
at
him
and
replied
of
all
that
thou
hast
said
to
me
i
will
not
attend
to
one
word
how
excellent
is
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

if
i
be
possessed
of
wealth
and
be
not
liberal
may
my
hand
never
be
extended
nor
my
foot
raised
shew
me
the
avaricious
who
hath
attained
glory
by
his
avarice
and
the
munificent
who
hath
died
through
his
munificence13
know
o
steward
he
continued
that
if
there
remain
in
thy
hands
what
will
suffice
for
my
dinner
thou
shalt
not
burden
me
with
anxiety
respecting
my
supperâso
the
steward
left
him
and
went
his
way
and
alee
noor-ed-deen
resumed
his
habits
of
extravagant
generosity
whenever
any
one
of
his
companions
said
verily
this
thing
is
beautifulâhe
would
reply
it
is
a
present
to
theeâand
if
any
said
o
my
master
verily
such
a
house
is
delightfulâhe
would
reply
it
is
a
present
to
thee

he
ceased
not
to
give
entertainments
to
his
companions
from
the
commencement
of
day
one
after
another
until
he
had
passed
in
this399
manner
a
whole
year
after
which
as
he
was
sitting
with
them
he
heard
the
slave-girl
recite
these
two
versesâ

thou
thoughtest
well
of
the
days
when
they
went
well
with
thee
and
fearedst
not
the
evil
that
destiny
was
bringing
thy
nights
were
peaceful
and
thou
wast
deceived
by
them
in
the
midst
of
their
brightness
there
cometh
gloom
and
immediately
after
a
person
knocked
at
the
door
so
noor-ed-deen
rose
and
one
of
his
companions
followed
him
without
his
knowledge
and
when
he
opened
the
door
he
beheld
his
steward
and
said
to
him
what
is
the
newsâo
my
master
answered
the
steward
that
which
i
feared
on
thy
account
hath
happened
to
theeâhow
is
that
asked
noor-ed-deen
the
steward
answered
know
that
there
remaineth
not
of
thy
property
in
my
hands
anything
equivalent
to
a
piece
of
silver
or
less
than
a
piece
of
silver
and
these
are
the
accounts
of
thy
expenses
and
of
thy
original
property
when
alee
noor-ed-deen
heard
these
words
he
hung
down
his
head
towards
the
ground
and
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
and
the
man
who
had
followed
him
secretly
to
pry
into
his
case
as
soon
as
he
heard
what
the
steward
told
him
returned
to
his
companions
and
said
to
them
see
what
ye
will
do
for
alee
noor-ed-deen
hath
become
a
bankrupt
so
when
noor-ed-deen
returned
to
them
grief
appeared
to
them
in
his
countenance
and
immediately
one
of
them
rose
and
looking
towards
him
said
to
him
o
my
master
i
desire
that
thou
wouldst
permit
me
to
departâwhy
thus
depart
to-day
said
noor-ed-deen
his
guest
answered
my
wife
is
to
give
birth
to
a
child
this
night
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
absent
from
her
i
desire
therefore
to
go
and
see
her
and
he
gave
him
leave
then
another
rose
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
noor-ed-deen
i
desire
to-day
to
visit
my
brother
for
he
celebrateth
the
circumcision
of
his
son
thus
each
of
them
asked
leave
of
him
deceitfully
and
went
his
way
until
all
had
departed

so
alee
noor-ed-deen
remained
alone
and
he
called
his
slave-girl
and
said
to
her
o
enees-el-jelees
seest
thou
not
what
hath
befallen
me
and
he
related
to
her
what
the
steward
had
told
him
she
replied
o
my
master
for
some
nights
past
i
have
been
anxious
to
speak
to
thee
of
this
affair
but
i
heard
thee
reciting
these
two
versesâ

when
fortune
is
liberal
to
thee
be
thou
liberal
to
all
others
before
she
escape
from
thee
for
liberality
will
not
annihilate
thy
wealth
when
she
is
favourable
nor
avarice
preserve
it
when
she
deserteth
thee
400
and
when
i
heard
thee
repeat
these
words
i
was
silent
and
would
not
make
any
remark
to
theeâo
enees-el-jelees
he
rejoined
thou
knowest
that
i
have
not
expended
my
wealth
but
on
my
companions
and
i
do
not
think
that
they
will
abandon
me
without
reliefâby
allah
said
she
they
will
be
of
no
use
to
thee
but
he
said
i
will
immediately
arise
and
go
to
them
and
knock
at
their
doors
perhaps
i
shall
obtain
from
them
something
which
i
will
employ
as
a
capital
wherewith
to
trade
and
i
will
cease
from
diversion
and
sport
so
he
arose
instantly
and
proceeded
without
stopping
until
he
arrived
at
the
by-street
in
which
his
ten
companions
resided
for
they
all
lived
in
that
same
street
and
he
advanced
to
the
first
door
and
knocked
and
there
came
forth
to
him
a
slave-girl
who
said
to
him
who
art
thou
he
answered
say
to
thy
masterâalee
noor-ed-deen
is
standing
at
the
door
and
saith
to
thee
thy
slave
kisseth
thy
hands
looking
for
a
favour
from
theeâand
the
girl
entered
and
acquainted
her
master
but
he
called
out
to
her
saying
return
and
tell
him
he
is
not
hereâthe
girl
therefore
returned
to
noor-ed-deen
and
said
to
him
my
master
sir
is
not
here
and
he
went
on
saying
within
myself
if
this
is
a
knave
and
hath
denied
himself
another
is
not
he
then
advanced
to
the
next
door
and
said
as
he
had
before
and
the
second
also
denied
himself
and
noor-ed-deen
exclaimedâ

they
are
gone
who
if
thou
stoodest
at
their
door
would
bestow
upon
thee
the
bounty
thou
desirest
by
allah
he
added
i
must
try
all
of
them
perchance
one
of
them
may
stand
me
in
the
place
of
all
the
others
and
he
went
round
to
all
the
ten
but
found
not
that
one
of
them
would
open
the
door
or
shew
himself
or
even
order
him
a
cake
of
bread
and
he
recited
the
following
versesâ

a
man
in
prosperity
resembleth
a
tree
around
which
people
flock
as
long
as
it
hath
fruit
but
as
soon
as
it
hath
dropped
all
that
it
bore
they
disperse
from
beneath
it
and
seek
another
perdition
to
all
the
people
of
this
age
for
i
find
not
one
man
of
integrity
among
ten
he
then
returned
to
his
slave
his
anxiety
had
increased
and
she
said
to
him
o
my
master
said
i
not
unto
thee
that
they
would
not
profit
theeâby
allah
he
replied
not
one
of
them
shewed
me
his
faceâo
my
master
rejoined
she
sell
of
the
moveables
of
the
house
a
little
at
a
time
and
expend
the
produce
and
he
did
so
until
he
had
sold
all
that
was
in
the
house
and
there
remained
nothing
in
his
pos401session
and
upon
this
he
looked
towards
enees-el-jelees
and
said
to
her
what
shall
we
do
nowâit
is
my
advice
o
my
master
she
answered
that
thou
arise
immediately
and
take
me
to
the
market
and
sell
me
for
thou
knowest
that
thy
father
purchased
me
for
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
perhaps
god
may
open
to
thee
a
way
to
obtain
a
part
of
this
price
and
if
god
have
decreed
our
reunion
we
shall
meet
again
but
he
replied
o
enees-el-jelees
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
endure
thy
separation
for
one
hourânor
is
the
like
easy
to
me
said
she
but
necessity
is
imperious
and
upon
this
he
took
enees-el-jelees
his
tears
flowing
down
his
cheeks
and
went
and
delivered
her
to
the
broker
saying
to
him
know
the
value
of
that
which
thou
art
to
cry
for
saleâo
my
master
noor-ed-deen
replied
the
broker
noble
qualities
are
held
in
remembrance
is
she
not
enees-el-jelees
whom
thy
father
purchased
of
me
for
ten
thousand
pieces
of
goldâhe
answered
yes
and
the
broker
thereupon
went
to
the
merchants
but
he
found
that
they
had
not
all
yet
assembled
so
he
waited
until
the
rest
had
come
and
the
market
was
filled
with
all
varieties
of
female
slaves
turkish
and
greek
and
circassian
and
georgian
and
abyssinian
and
when
he
beheld
its
crowded
state
he
arose
and
exclaimed
o
merchants
o
possessors
of
wealth
everything
that
is
round
is
not
a
nut
nor
is
everything
long
a
banana
nor
is
everything
that
is
red
meat
nor
is
everything
white
fat
nor
is
everything
that
is
ruddy
wine
nor
is
everything
tawny
a
date
o
merchants
this
precious
pearl
whose
value
no
money
can
equal
with
what
sum
will
ye
open
the
bidding
for
herâand
one
of
the
merchants
answered
with
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold14

the
wezeer
el-moeen
in
the
slave-market
but
lo
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
was
in
the
market
and
seeing
alee
noor-ed-deen
standing
there
he
said
within
himself
what
doth
he
want
here
having
nothing
left
wherewith
to
purchase
female
slaves
then
casting
his
eyes
around
and
hearing
the
broker
as
he
stood
crying
in
the
market
with
the
merchants
around
him
he
said
within
himself
i
do
not
imagine
anything
else
than
that
he
hath
become
a
bankrupt
and
come
forth
with
the
slave-girl
to
sell
her
and
if
this
be
the
case
how
pleasant
to
my
heart
he
then
called
the
crier
who
approached
him
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him15
and
the
wezeer
said
to
him
i
desire
this
female
slave
whom
thou
art
crying
for
sale
the
broker
therefore
being
unable
to
oppose
his
wish
brought
the
slave
and
placed
her
before
him
and
when
he
beheld
her
and
considered
her
charms
her
elegant
figure
and
her
soft
speech
he
was
delighted
with
her
and
said
to
the
broker
to402
what
has
the
bidding
for
her
amounted
the
broker
answered
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
and
as
soon
as
the
merchants
heard
this
not
one
of
them
could
bid
another
piece
of
silver
or
of
gold
but
all
of
them
drew
back
knowing
the
tyrannical
conduct
of
that
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
then
looked
towards
the
broker
and
said
to
him
why
standest
thou
still
take
away
the
slave-girl
for
me
at
the
price
of
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
and
thou
wilt
have
five
hundred
for
thyselfâso
the
broker
went
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
the
slave-girl
is
lost
to
thee
without
priceâhow
so
said
noor-ed-deen
the
broker
answered
we
opened
the
bidding
for
her
at
four
thousand
and
five
hundred
pieces
of
gold
but
this
tyrant
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
came
into
the
market
and
when
he
beheld
the
damsel
she
pleased
him
and
he
said
to
me
ask
her
owner
if
he
will
agree
for
four
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
five
hundred
for
theeâand
i
doubt
not
but
he
knoweth
that
the
slave
belongeth
to
thee
and
if
he
give403
thee
her
price
immediately
it
will
be
through
the
goodness
of
god
but
i
know
from
his
injustice
that
he
will
write
thee
an
order
upon
some
of
his
agents
for
the
money
and
then
send
to
them
and
desire
them
to
give
thee
nothing
and
every
time
that
thou
shalt
go
to
demand
it
of
them
they
will
say
to
thee
to-morrow
we
will
pay
theeâand
they
will
not
cease
to
promise
thee
and
to
defer
from
day
to
day
notwithstanding
thy
pride
and
when
they
are
overcome
by
thy
importunity
they
will
say
give
us
the
written
orderâand
as
soon
as
they
have
received
the
paper
from
thee
they
will
tear
it
in
pieces
so
thou
wilt
lose
the
price
of
the
slave

when
noor-ed-deen
therefore
heard
these
words
of
the
broker
he
said
to
him
what
is
to
be
done
the
broker
answered
i
will
give
thee
a
piece
of
advice
and
if
thou
receive
it
from
me
thou
wilt
have
better
fortuneâwhat
is
it
asked
noor-ed-deenâthat
thou
come
to
me
immediately
answered
the
broker
while
i
am
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
market
and
take
the
slave-girl
from
me
and
give
her
a
blow
with
thy
hand
and
say
to
her
wo
to
thee
i
have
expiated
my
oath
that
i
swore
and
brought
thee
to
the
market
because
i
swore
to
thee
that
thou
shouldst
be
exposed
in
the
market
and
that
the
broker
should
cry
thee
for
saleâif
thou
do
this
perhaps
the
trick
will
deceive
him
and
the
people
and
they
will
believe
that
thou
tookest
her
not
to
the
market
but
to
expiate
the
oathâthis
replied
noor-ed-deen
is
the
right
counsel
so
the
broker
returned
into
the
midst
of
the
market
and
taking
hold
of
the
hand
of
the
slave-girl
made
a
sign
to
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
saying
o
my
lord
this
is
her
owner
who
hath
just
come
then
alee
noor-ed-deen
advanced
to
the
broker
and
tore
the
damsel
from
him
and
struck
her
with
his
hand
saying
to
her
wo
to
thee
i
have
brought
thee
to
the
market
for
the
sake
of
expiating
my
oath
go
home
and
disobey
me
not
again
i
want
not
thy
price
that
i
should
sell
thee
and
if
i
sold
the
furniture
of
the
house
and
everything
else
of
the
kind
over
and
over
again
their
produce
would
not
amount
to
thy
priceâbut
when
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
beheld
noor-ed-deen
he
said
to
him
wo
to
thee
hast
thou
anything
left
to
be
sold
or
boughtâand
he
would
have
laid
violent
hands
upon
him
the
merchants
then
looked
towards
noor-ed-deen
and
they
all
loved
him
and
he
said
to
them
here
am
i
before
you
and
ye
have
all
known
his
tyrannyâby
allah
exclaimed
the
wezeer
were
it
not
for
you
i
had
killed
him
then
all
of
them
made
signs
one
to
another
with
the
eye
and
said
not
one
of
us
will
interfere
between
thee
and
him
and
upon404
this
alee
noor-ed-deen
went
up
to
the
wezeer
the
son
of
sÃwee
and
noor-ed-deen
was
a
man
of
courage
and
he
dragged
the
wezeer
from
his
saddle
and
threw
him
upon
the
ground
there
was
at
that
spot
a
kneading-place
for
mud16
and
the
wezeer
fell
into
the
midst
of
it
and
noor-ed-deen
beat
him
with
his
fist
and
a
blow
fell
upon
his
teeth
by
which
his
beard
became
dyed
with
his
blood
now
there
were
with
the
wezeer
ten
memlooks
and
when
they
saw
noor-ed-deen
treat
their
master
in
this
manner
they
put
their
hands
upon
the
hilts
of
their
swords
and
would
have
fallen
upon
him
and
cut
him
in
pieces
but
the
people
said
to
them
this
is
a
wezeer
and
this
is
the
son
of
a
wezeer
and
perhaps
they
may
make
peace
with
each
other
and
ye
will
incur
the
anger
of
both
of
them
or
perhaps
a
blow
may
fall
upon
your
master
and
ye
will
all
of
you
die
the
most
ignominious
of
deaths
it
is
advisable
therefore
that
ye
interfere
not
between
themâand
when
alee
noor-ed-deen
had
ceased
from
beating
the
wezeer
he
took
his
slave-girl
and
returned
to
his
house

el-moeen
in
his
abasement
the
wezeer
the
son
of
sÃwee
then
immediately
arose
and
his
dress
which
before
was
white
was
now
dyed
with
three
colours
the
colour
of
mud
and
the
colour
of
blood
and
the
colour
of
ashes17
and
when
he
beheld
himself
in
this
condition
he
took
a
round
mat18
and
hung
it
to
his
neck
and
took
in
his
hand
two
bundles
of
coarse
grass19
and
went
and
stood
beneath
the
palace
of
the
suláÃn
and
cried
out405
o
king
of
the
age
i
am
oppressedâso
they
brought
him
before
the
king
who
looked
at
him
attentively
and
saw
that
he
was
his
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
he
said
therefore
who
hath
done
thus
unto
theeâand
the
wezeer
cried
and
moaned
and
repeated
these
two
versesâ

shall
fortune
oppress
me
while
thou
existest
and
the
dogs
devour
me
when
thou
art
a
lion
shall
all
else
who
are
dry
drink
freely
from
thy
tanks
and
i
thirst
in
thine
asylum
when
thou
art
as
rain
âo
my
lord
he
continued
thus
is
every
one
who
loveth
thee
and
serveth
thee
these
afflictions
always
befall
himâand
who
said
the
king
again
hath
done
thus
unto
theeâknow
answered
the
wezeer
that
i
went
forth
to-day
to
the
market
of
the
female
slaves
with
the
idea
of
buying
a
cook-maid
and
saw
in
the
market
a
slave-girl
the
like
of
whom
i
had
never
in
my
life
beheld
and
the
broker
said
that
she
belonged
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
now
our
lord
the
suláÃn
had
given
his
father
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
to
buy
for
him
with
it
a
beautiful
female
slave
and
he
bought
that
girl
and
she
pleased
him
so
he
gave
her
to
his
son
and
when
his
father
died
the
son
pursued
the
path
of
prodigality
until
he
sold
all
his
houses
and
gardens
and
utensils
and
when
he
had
become
a
bankrupt
nothing
else
remaining
in
his
possession
he
took
the
slave-girl
to
the
market
to
sell
her
and
delivered
her
to
the
broker
so
he
cried
her
for
sale
and
the
merchants
continued
bidding
for
her
until
her
price
amounted
to
four
thousand
pieces
of
gold
whereupon
i
said
to
myself
i
will
buy
this
for
our
lord
the
suláÃn
for
her
original
price
was
from
him
i
therefore
said
o
my
son
receive
her
price
four
thousand
pieces
of
gold
but
when
he
heard
my
words
he
looked
at
me
and
replied
o
ill-omened
old
man
i
will
sell
her
to
the
jews
and
the
christians
rather
than
to
theeâi
then
said
to
him
i
would
not
buy
her
for
myself
but
for
our
lord
the
suláÃn
who
is
our
benefactor
as
soon
however
as
he
had
heard
these
words
from
me
he
was
filled
with
rage
and
dragged
me
and
threw
me
down
from
the
horse
notwithstanding
my
advanced
age
and
beat
me
and
ceased
not
to
do
so
until
he
left
me
in
the
state
in
which
thou
seest
me
nothing
exposed
me
to
all
this
ill
treatment
but
my
coming
to
purchase
this
slave-girl
for
your
majestyâthe
wezeer
then
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
and
lay
weeping
and
trembling

now
when
the
suláÃn
beheld
his
condition
and
had
heard
his
speech
the
vein
of
anger
swelled
between
his
eyes
and
he
looked406
towards
the
members
of
his
court
who
were
attending
him
whereupon
forty
swordsmen
stood
before
him
and
he
said
to
them
descend
immediately
to
the
house
of
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
plunder
it
and
demolish
it
and
bring
hither
him
and
the
slave-girl
with
their
hands
bound
behind
them
drag
them
along
upon
their
faces
and
so
bring
them
before
me
they
replied
we
hear
and
obeyâand
went
forth
to
repair
to
the
house
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
but
there
was
in
the
court
of
the
suláÃn
a
chamberlain
named
alam-ed-deen
senjer
who
had
been
one
of
the
memlooks
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
the
father
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
when
he
heard
the
order
of
the
suláÃn
and
saw
the
enemies
prepared
to
slay
his
masters
son
it
was
insupportable
to
him
so
he
mounted
his
horse
and
proceeded
to
the
house
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
knocked
at
the
door
noor-ed-deen
came
forth
to
him
and
when
he
saw
him
knew
him
and
would
have
saluted
him
but
he
said
o
my
master
this
is
not
a
time
for
salutation
nor
for
talking
noor-ed-deen
said
o
alam-ed-deen
what
is
the
news
he
replied
save
thyself
by
flight
thou
and
the
slave-girl
for
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
hath
set
up
a
snare
for
you
and
if
ye
fall
into
his
hands
he
will
slay
you
the
suláÃn
hath
sent
to
you
forty
swordsmen
and
it
is
my
advice
that
ye
fly
before
the
evil
fall
upon
you
then
senjer
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
noor-ed-deen
with
some
pieces
of
gold
and
he
counted
them
and
found
them
to
be
forty
pieces
and
he
said
o
my
master
receive
these
and
if
i
had
with
me
more
i
would
give
it
thee
but
this
is
not
a
time
for
expostulating
and
upon
this
noor-ed-deen
went
in
to
the
damsel
and
acquainted
her
with
the
occurrence
and
she
was
confounded

the
two
then
went
forth
immediately
from
the
city
and
god
let
down
the
veil
of
his
protection
upon
them
and
they
proceeded
to
the
bank
of
the
river
where
they
found
a
vessel
ready
to
sail
the
master
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
and
saying
he
who
hath
anything
to
do
whether
leave-taking
or
procuring
provisions
or
who
hath
forgotten
aught
let
him
do
what
he
desireth
and
return
for
we
are
going
and
they
all
replied
we
have
nothing
remaining
to
do
o
master
so
upon
this
the
master
said
to
his
crew
quick
loose
the
ropes
end
and
pull
up
the
stake20âand
alee
noor-ed-deen
exclaimed
whither
o
master
he
answered
to
the
abode
of
peace
baghdÃd
and
noor-ed-deen
embarked
and
the
damsel
with
him
and
they
set
the
vessel
afloat
and
spread
the
sails
and
it
shot
along
like
a
bird
with
its
pair
of
wings
carrying
them
forward
with
a
favourable
wind407

meanwhile
the
forty
men
whom
the
suláÃn
had
sent
came
to
the
house
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
broke
open
the
doors
and
entered
and
searched
all
the
chambers
but
without
success
so
they
demolished
the
house
and
returned
and
acquainted
the
suláÃn
who
said
search
for
them
in
every
place
where
they
may
beâand
they
replied
we
hear
and
obey
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
then
descended
to
his
house
after
the
suláÃn
had
invested
him
with
a
robe
of
honour
and
had
said
to
him
none
shall
take
vengeance
for
thee
but
myself
and
he
greeted
the
king
with
a
prayer
for
long
life
and
his
heart
was
set
at
ease
and
the
suláÃn
gave
orders
to
proclaim
throughout
the
city
o
all
ye
people
our
lord
the
suláÃn
hath
commanded
that
whoever
shall
meet
with
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
bring
him
to
the
suláÃn
shall
be
invested
with
a
robe
of
honour
and
he
will
give
him
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
he
who
shall
conceal
him
or
know
where
he
is
and
not
give
information
thereof
will
merit
the
exemplary
punishment
that
shall
befall
him
so
all
the
people
began
to
search
for
him
but
could
not
trace
himâsuch
was
the
case
with
these
people

now
as
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
and
his
slave
they
arrived
in
safety
at
baghdÃd
and
the
master
of
the
vessel
said
to
them
this
is
baghdÃd
and
it
is
a
city
of
security
winter
with
its
cold
hath
departed
from
it
and
the
spring-quarter
hath
come
with
its
roses
and
its
trees
are
in
blossom
and
its
waters
are
flowing
and
upon
this
alee
noor-ed-deen
landed
with
his
slave-girl
and
gave
the
master
five
pieces
of
gold
they
then
walked
a
little
way
and
destiny
cast
them
among
the
gardens
and
they
came
to
a
place
which
they
found
swept
and
sprinkled
with
long
maááabahs
and
pots
suspended
filled
with
water
and
over
it
was
a
covering
of
trellis-work
of
canes
extending
along
the
whole
length
of
a
lane
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
the
gate
of
a
garden
but
this
was
shut
and
noor-ed-deen
said
to
the
damsel
by
allah
this
is
a
pleasant
placeâand
she
replied
o
my
master
let
us
sit
down
a
while
upon
one
of
these
maááabahs
so
they
mounted
and
seated
themselves
there
and
they
washed
their
faces
and
hands
and
enjoyed
the
current
of
the
zephyr
and
sleptâglory
be
to
him
who
sleepeth
not

the
lane
leading
to
the
garden
of
delight
this
garden
was
called
the
garden
of
delight
and
in
it
was
a
palace
called
the
palace
of
diversion
and
it
belonged
to
the
khaleefeh
hÃroon
er-rasheed
who
when
his
heart
was
contracted
used
to
come
to
this
garden
and
enter
the
palace
above
mentioned
and
there
sit
the
palace
had
eighty
latticed
windows
and
eighty
lamps
were
sus408pended
in
it
and
in
the
midst
of
it
was
a
great
candlestick
of
gold
and
when
the
khaleefeh
entered
it
he
commanded
the
female
slaves
to
open
the
windows
and
ordered
is-áÃá
the
cup-companion
to
sing
with
them
so
his
heart
became
dilated
and
his
anxiety
ceased
there
was
a
superintendent
to
the
garden
an
old
man
named
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
and
it
happened
that
he
went
forth
once
to
transact
some
business
and
found
there
persons
diverting
themselves
with
women
of
suspicious
character
whereupon
he
was
violently
enraged
and
having
waited
until
the
khaleefeh
came
thither
some
days
after
he
acquainted
him
with
this
occurrence
and
the
khaleefeh
said
whomsoever
thou
shalt
find
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
do
with
him
what
thou
wilt
now
on
this
day
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
went
out
to
transact
an
affair
of
business
and
found
the
two
sleeping
at
the
garden-gate
covered
with
a
single
izÃr
and
he
said
do
not
these
two
persons409
know
that
the
khaleefeh
hath
given
me
permission
to
kill
every
one
whom
i
find
here
but
i
will
only
give
these
two
a
slight
beating
that
no
one
may
again
approach
the
gate
of
the
garden
he
then
cut
a
green
palm-stick
and
went
forth
to
them
and
raised
his
hand
until
the
whiteness
of
his
arm-pit
appeared
and
was
about
to
beat
them
but
he
reflected
in
his
mind
and
said
o
ibrÃheem
how
shouldst
thou
beat
them
when
thou
knowest
not
their
case
they
may
be
two
strangers
or
of
the
children
of
the
road21
whom
destiny
hath
cast
here
i
will
therefore
uncover
their
faces
and
look
at
themâso
he
lifted
up
the
izÃr
from
their
faces
and
said
these
are
two
handsome
persons
and
it
is
not
proper
that
i
should
beat
them
and
he
covered
their
faces
again
and
approaching
the
foot
of
alee
noor-ed-deen
began
to
rub
it
gently22
whereupon
noor-ed-deen
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
he
was
an
old
man
and
he
blushed
and
drew
in
his
feet
and
sitting
up
took
the
hand
of
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
and
kissed
it
and
the
sheykh
said
to
him
o
my
son
whence
are
yeâo
my
master
he
answered
we
are
strangersâand
a
tear
gushed
from
his
eye
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
then
said
to
him
o
my
son
know
that
the
prophet
god
bless
and
save
him
hath
enjoined
generosity
to
the
stranger
wilt
thou
not
arise
o
my
son
and
enter
the
garden
and
divert
thyself
in
it
that
thy
heart
may
be
dilatedâo
my
master
said
noor-ed-deen
to
whom
doth
this
garden
belong
the
sheykh
answered
o
my
son
this
garden
i
inherited
from
my
family
and
his
design
in
saying
this
was
only
that
they
might
feel
themselves
at
ease
and
enter
the
garden
and
when
noor-ed-deen
heard
his
words
he
thanked
him
and
arose
together
with
his
slave
and
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
preceding
them
they
entered
the
garden

the
gate
was
arched
and
over
it
were
vines
with
grapes
of
different
colours
the
red
like
rubies
and
the
black
like
ebony
they
entered
a
bower
and
found
within
it
fruits
growing
in
clusters

pouring
forth
its
melodious

the
turtle-dove
filled
the
place
with
its
cooing

blackbird
in
its
singing
resembled
a
human
being

a
person
exhilarated
by

of

were

almond-apricot

the
apricot
of
khurÃsÃn
the
plum
of
a
colour
like
the

beauties
the
cherry
delighting
the
sense
of
every

the
red

white
and
the
green
fig
of
the
most
beautiful
colours410
and
flowers
like
pearls
and
coral
the
rose

redness
put
to
shame
the
cheeks
of
the
lovely

violet

sulphur
in
contact
with

the
myrtle

bespangled
with

in

delight
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
conducted
them
into
the
elevated
saloon23
and
they
were
charmed
with
its
beauty
and
the
extraordinary
elegances
which
it
displayed
and
seated
themselves
in
one
of
the
windows
and
noor-ed-deen
reflecting
upon
his
past
entertainments
exclaimed
by
allah
this
place
is
most
delightful
it
hath
reminded
me
of
past
events
and
quenched
in
me
an
anguish
like
the
fire
of
the
ghaáÃ

sheykh
ibrÃheem
then
brought
to
them
some
food
and
they
ate
to
satisfaction
and
washed
their
hands
and
noor-ed-deen
seating411
himself
again
in
one
of
the
windows
called
to
his
slave
and
she
came
to
him
and
they
sat
gazing
at
the
trees
laden
with
all
kinds
of
fruits
after
which
noor-ed-deen
looked
towards
the
sheykh
and
said
to
him
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
hast
thou
not
any
beverage
for
people
drink
after
eatingâso
the
sheykh
brought
him
some
sweet
and
cold
water
but
noor-ed-deen
said
this
is
not
the
beverage
i
desireâdost
thou
want
wine
asked
the
sheykhâyes
answered
noor-ed-deen
the
sheykh
exclaimed
i
seek
refuge
with
allah
from
it
verily
for
thirteen
years
i
have
done
nothing
of
that
kind
for
the
prophet

and
save
him

its
drinker
and
its
presser
and
its
carrierâhear
from
me
two
words
said
noor-ed-deen
the
sheykh
replied
say
what
thou
wilt
so
he
said
if
thou
be
neither
the
presser
of
the
wine
nor
its
drinker
nor
its
carrier
will
aught
of
the
curse
fall
upon
thee
the
sheykh
answered
noâthen
take
this
piece
of
gold
rejoined
noor-ed-deen
and
these
two
pieces
of
silver
and
mount
the
ass
and
halt
at
a
distance
from
the
place
and
whatsoever
man
thou
findest
to
buy
it
call
to
him
and
say
to
him

these
two
pieces
of

and
with
this
piece

which
befalleth

rest

the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
after
laughing
at
his
words
replied
by
allah
i
have
never
seen
one
more
witty
than
thou
nor
heard
speech
more
sweet
and
noor-ed-deen
said
to
him
we
have
become
dependant
upon
thee
and
thou
hast
nothing
to
do
but
to
comply
with
our
wishes
bring
us
therefore
all
that
we
requireâo
my
son
said
the
sheykh
my
buttery
here
is
before
thee
and
it
was
the
store-room
furnished
for
the
prince
of
the
faithful
enter
it
then
and
take
from
it
what
thou
wilt
for
it
containeth
more
than
thou
desirest
so
noor-ed-deen
entered
the
store-room
and
beheld
in
it
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
crystal
adorned
with
a
variety
of
jewels
and
he
took
out
such
of
them
as
he
desired
and
poured
the
wine
into
the
vessels
of
earthenware
and
bottles
of
glass
and
he
and
the
damsel
began
to
drink
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
the
things
which
they
beheld
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
then
brought
to
them
sweet-scented
flowers
and
seated
himself
at
a
distance
from
them
and
they
continued
drinking
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
delight
until
the
wine
took
effect
upon
them
and
their
cheeks
reddened
and
their
eyes
wantoned
like
those
of
the
gazelle
and
their
hair
hung
down25
whereupon
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
said
what
aileth
me
that
i
am
sitting
at
a
distance
from
them412
why
should
i
not
sit
by
them
and
when
shall
i
be
in
the
company
of
such
as
these
two
who
are
like
two
moonsâhe
then
advanced
and
seated
himself
at
the
edge
of
the
raised
portion
of
the
floor
and
noor-ed-deen
said
to
him
o
my
master
by
my
life
i
conjure
thee
to
approach
and
join
us
so
he
went
to
them
and
noor-ed-deen
filled
a
cup
and
looking
at
the
sheykh
said
to
him
drink
that
thou
mayest
know
how
delicious
is
its
flavour
but
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
exclaimed
i
seek
refuge
with
allah
verily
for
thirteen
years
i
have
done
nothing
of
that
kindâand
noor-ed-deen
feigning
to
pay
no
attention
to
him
drank
the
cup
and
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
pretending
that
intoxication
had
overcome
him

enees-el-jelees
offering
the
wine
upon
this
enees-el-jelees
looked
towards
the
sheykh
and
said
to
him
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
see
how
this
man
hath
treated
meâo
my
mistress
said
he
what
aileth
him
she
rejoined
always
doth
he
treat
me
thus
he
drinketh
a
while
and
then
sleepeth
and
i
remain
alone
and
find
no
one
to
keep
me
company
over
my
cup
if
i
drink
who
will
serve
me
and
if
i
sing
who
will
hear
meâthe
sheykh
moved
with
tenderness
and
affection
for
her
by
her
words
replied
it
is
not
proper
that
a
cup-companion
be
thus
the
damsel
then
filled
a
cup
and
looking
at
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
said
to
him
i
conjure
thee
by
my
life
that
thou
take
it
and
drink
it
reject
it
not
but
accept
it
and
refresh
my
heart
so
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
took
the
cup
and
drank
it
and
she
filled
for
him
a
second
time
and
handed
it
to
him
saying
o
my
master
this
remaineth
for
thee
he
replied
by
allah
i
cannot
drink
it
that
which
i
have
drunk
is
enough
for
me
but
she
said
by
allah
it
is
indispensableâand
he
took
the
cup
and
drank
it
she
then
gave
him
the
third
and
he
took
it
and
was
about
to
drink
it
when
lo
noor-ed-deen
raised
himself
and
said
to
him
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
what
is
this
did
i
not
conjure
thee
a
while
ago
and
thou
refusedst
and
saidst
verily
for
thirteen
years
i
have
not
done
itâthe
sheykh
ibrÃheem
touched
with
shame
replied
by
allah
i
am
not
in
fault
for
she
pressed
me413
and
noor-ed-deen
laughed
and
they
resumed
their
carousal
and
the
damsel
turning
her
eyes
towards
her
master
said
to
him
o
my
master
drink
thou
and
do
not
urge
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
that
i
may
divert
thee
with
the
sight
of
him
so
she
began
to
fill
and
to
hand
to
her
master
and
her
master
filled
and
gave
to
her
and
thus
they
continued
to
do
time
after
time
till
at
length
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
looked
towards
them
and
said
what
meaneth
this
and
what
sort
of
carousal
is
this
wherefore
do
ye
not
give
me
to
drink
since
i
have
become
your
cup-companionâat
this
they
both
laughed
until
they
became
almost
senseless
and
then
drank
and
gave
him
to
drink
and
they
continued
thus
until
the
expiration
of
a
third
of
the
night
when
the
damsel
said
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
with
thy
permission
shall
i
rise
and
light
one
of
the
candles
which
are
arranged
hereârise
he
answered
but
light
not
more
than
one
candle
but
she
sprang
upon
her
feet
and
beginning
with
the
first
candle
proceeded
until
she
had
lighted
eighty
she
then
sat
down
again
and
presently
noor-ed-deen
said
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
in
what
favour
am
i
held
with
thee
wilt
thou
not
allow
me
to
light
one
of
these
lampsâthe
sheykh
answered
arise
and
light
one
lamp
and
be
not
thou
also
troublesome
so
he
arose
and
beginning
with
the
first
lamp
lighted
all
the
eighty
and
the
saloon
seemed
to
dance
and
after
this
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
overcome
by
intoxication
said
to
them
ye
are
more
frolicksome
than
iâand
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
and
opened
all
the
windows
and
sat
down
again
with
them
and
they
continued
carousing
and
reciting
verses
and
the
place
rang
with
their
merriment

now
god
the
all-seeing
and
all-knowing
who
hath
appointed
a
cause
to
every
event
had
decreed
that
the
khaleefeh
should
be
sitting
that
night
at
one
of
the
windows
looking
towards
the
tigris
by
moonlight
and
he
looked
in
that
direction
and
saw
the
light
of
lamps
and
candles
reflected
in
the
river
and
turning
his
eyes
up
towards
the
palace
in
the
garden
he
beheld
it
beaming
with
those
candles
and
lamps
and
exclaimed
bring
hither
to
me
jaáºfar
el-barmekee
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
jaáºfar
stood
before
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
the
khaleefeh
said
to
him
o
dog
of
wezeers
dost
thou
serve
me
and
not
acquaint
me
with
what
happeneth
in
the
city
of
baghdÃdâwhat
asked
jaáºfar
is
the
occasion
of
these
words
the
khaleefeh
answered
if
the
city
of
baghdÃd
were
not
taken
from
me
the
palace
of
diversion
were
not
enlivened
with
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
candles
and
its
windows
were
not
opened
wo
to
thee
who
could
do
these
things
unless
the
office
of
khaleefeh
were
taken414
from
meâwho
said
jaáºfar
the
muscles
of
his
side
quivering
from
fear
informed
thee
that
the
lamps
and
candles
were
lighted
in
the
palace
of
diversion
and
that
its
windows
were
opened
the
khaleefeh
replied
advance
hither
to
me
and
look
so
jaáºfar
approached
the
khaleefeh
and
looking
towards
the
garden
beheld
the
palace
as
it
were
a
flame
of
fire
its
light
surpassing
that
of
the
moon
he
desired
therefore
to
make
an
excuse
for
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
the
superintendent
thinking
from
what
he
beheld
that
the
event
might
have
occurred
through
his
permission
and
accordingly
he
said
o
prince
of
the
faithful
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
last
week
said
to
me
o
my
master
jaáºfar
i
am
desirous
of
entertaining
my
children
during
my
life
and
the
life
of
the
prince
of
the
faithfulâand
what
said
i
is
thy
design
in
saying
this
he
answered
it
is
my
wish
that
thou
wouldst
obtain
for
me
permission
from
the
khaleefeh
that
i
may
celebrate
the
circumcision
of
my
sons
in
the
palace
so
i
said
do
what
thou
wilt
with
respect
to
the
entertainment
of
thy
sons
and
if
god
will
i
shall
have
an
interview
with
the
khaleefeh
and
will
acquaint
him
with
it
and
he
left
me
thus
and
i
forgot
to
acquaint
theeâo
jaáºfar
said
the
khaleefeh
thou
wast
guilty
of
one
offence
against
me
and
then
thine
offence
became
two
for
thou
hast
erred
in
two
points
the
first
thy
not
acquainting
me
with
this
affair
and
the
second
thy
not
accomplishing
the
desire
of
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
for
he
did
not
come
to
thee
and
address
thee
with
these
words
but
to
hint
a
request
for
some
money
by
the
aid
of
which
to
effect
his
design
and
thou
neither
gavest
him
anything
nor
acquaintedst
me
that
i
might
give
himâo
prince
of
the
faithful
replied
jaáºfar
i
forgot

the
khaleefeh
and
the
wezeer
in
the
tree
the
khaleefeh
then
said
by
my
forefathers
i
will
not
pass
the
remainder
of
my
night
but
with
him
for
he
is
a
just
man
who
frequenteth
the
sheykhs26
and
attendeth
to
the
poor
and
favoureth
the
indigent
and
i
imagine
all
his
acquaintances
are
with
him
this
night
so
i
must
repair
to
him
perhaps
one
of
them
may
offer
up
for
us
a
prayer
productive
of
good
to
us
in
this
world
and
the
next
and
probably
some
advantage
may
accrue
to
him
from
my
presence
and
he
will
receive
pleasure
from
this
together
with
his
friendsâo
prince
of
the
faithful
replied
jaáºfar
the
greater
part
of
the
night
hath
passed
and
they
are
now
about
to
disperse
but
the
khaleefeh
said
we
must
go
to
them
and
jaáºfar
was
silent
and
was
perplexed
in
his
mind
not
knowing
what
to
do
so
the
khaleefeh
rose
upon
his
feet
and
jaáºfar
rose
and
preceded
him
and
mesroor
the
eunuch
went
with
them
the
three
walked
on
reflecting
and
departing
from
the415
palace
proceeded
through
the
streets
in
the
attire
of
merchants
until
they
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
above
mentioned
and
the
khaleefeh
approaching
it
found
it
open
and
he
was
surprised
and
said
see
o
jaáºfar
how
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
hath
left
the
gate
open
until
this
hour
which
is
not
his
usual
custom
they
then
entered
and
came
to
the
end
of
the
garden
where
they
stopped
beneath
the
palace
and
the
khaleefeh
said
o
jaáºfar
i
desire
to
take
a
view
of
them
secretly
before
i
go
up
to
them
that
i
may
see
how
the
sheykhs
are
occupied
in
the
dispensing
of
their
blessings
and
the
employment
of
their
miraculous
powers
for
they
have
qualities
which
distinguish
them
both
in
their
private
retirements
and
in
their
public
exercises
and
now
we
hear
not
their
voices
nor
discover
any
indication
of
their
presence
having
thus
said
he
looked
around
and
seeing
a
tall
walnut
tree
he
said
o
jaáºfar
i
would
climb
this
tree
for
its
branches
are
near
to
the
windows
and
look
at
them
and
accordingly
he
ascended
the
tree
and
climbed
from
branch
to
branch
until
he
came
to
that
which
was
opposite
to
one
of
the
windows
and
there
he
sat416
and
looking
in
through
this
window
of
the
palace
beheld
a
damsel
and
a
young
man
like
two
moons
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
created
them
and
he
saw
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
sitting
with
a
cup
in
his
hand
and
saying
o
mistress
of
beauties
drinking
unaccompanied
by
merry
sounds
is
not
pleasant
hast
thou
not
heard
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

circulate
it
in
the
large
cup
and
in
the
small
and
receive
it
from
the
hand
of
the
shining
moon27
and
drink
not
without
merry
sounds
for
i
have
observed
that
horses
drink
to
the
sound
of
whistling
when
the
khaleefeh
witnessed
this
conduct
of
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
the
vein
of
anger
swelled
between
his
eyes
and
he
descended
and
said
o
jaáºfar
i
have
never
seen
anything
of
the
miraculous
performances
of
the
just
such
as
i
have
beheld
this
night
ascend
therefore
thyself
also
into
this
tree
and
look
lest
the
blessings
of
the
just
escape
thee28âon
hearing
the
words
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
jaáºfar
was
perplexed
at
his
situation
and
he
climbed
up
into
the
tree
and
looked
and
saw
noor-ed-deen
and
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
and
the
damsel
and
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
had
the
cup
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
he
beheld
this
he
made
sure
of
destruction
and
he
descended
and
stood
before
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
the
khaleefeh
said
o
jaáºfar
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
made
us
to
be
of
the
number
of
those
who
follow
the
external
ordinances
of
the
holy
law
and
averted
from
us
the
sin
of
disguising
ourselves
by
the
practice
of
hypocrisy
but
jaáºfar
was
unable
to
reply
from
his
excessive
confusion
the
khaleefeh
then
looked
towards
him
and
said
who
can
have
brought
these
persons
hither
and
admitted
them
into
my
palace
but
the
like
of
this
young
man
and
this
damsel
in
beauty
and
loveliness
and
symmetry
of
form
mine
eye
hath
never
beheldâjaáºfar
now
conceiving
a
hope
that
the
khaleefeh
might
be
propitiated
replied
thou
hast
spoken
truly
o
prince
of
the
faithful
and
the
khaleefeh
said
o
jaáºfar
climb
up
with
us
upon
this
branch
which
is
opposite
them
that
we
may
amuse
ourselves
by
observing
them
so
they
both
climbed
up
into
the
tree
and
looking
at
them
heard
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
say
o
my
mistress
i
have
relinquished
decorum
by
the
drinking
of
wine
but
the
pleasure
of
this
is
not
complete
without
the
melodious
sounds
of
stringed
instrumentsâo
sheykh
ibrÃheem
replied
enees-el-jelees
by
allah
if
we
had
any
musical
instrument
our
happiness
were
perfect
and
when
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
heard
her
words
he
rose
upon
his
feetâthe
khaleefeh
said417
to
jaáºfar
what
may
he
be
going
to
do
jaáºfar
replied
i
know
notâand
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
went
away
and
returned
with
a
lute
and
the
khaleefeh
looking
attentively
at
it
saw
that
it
was
the
lute
of
is-áÃá
the
cup-companion
and
said
by
allah
if
this
damsel
sing
not
well
i
will
crucify
you
all
but
if
she
sing
well
i
will
pardon
them
and
crucify
thee
so
jaáºfar
said
o
allah
let
her
not
sing
wellâwhy
asked
the
khaleefehâthat
thou
mayest
crucify
all
of
us
answered
jaáºfar
and
then
we
shall
cheer
one
another
by
conversation
and
the
khaleefeh
laughed
and
the
damsel
took
the
lute
and
tuned
its
strings
and
played
upon
it
in
a
manner
that
would
melt
iron
and
inspire
an
idiot
with
intellect
after
which
she
sang
with
such
sweetness
that
the
khaleefeh
exclaimed
o
jaáºfar
never
in
my
life
have
i
heard
so
enchanting
a
voice
as
thisâperhaps
said
jaáºfar
the
anger
of
the
khaleefeh
hath
departed
from
himâyea
he
answered
it
hath
departed
he
then
descended
with
jaáºfar
from
the
tree
and
looking
towards
him
said
i
am
desirous
of
going
up
to
them
to
sit
with
them
and
to
hear
the
damsel
sing
before
meâo
prince
of
the
faithful
replied
jaáºfar
if
thou
go
up
to
them
probably
they
will
be
troubled
by
thy
presence
and
as
to
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
he
will
assuredly
die
of
fear
the
khaleefeh
therefore
said
o
jaáºfar
thou
must
acquaint
me
with
some
stratagem
by
means
of
which
i
may
learn
the
truth
of
the
affair
without
their
knowing
that
i
have
discovered
them
and
he
and
jaáºfar
walked
towards
the
tigris
reflecting
upon
this
matter
and
lo
a
fisherman
stood
beneath
the
windows
of
the
palace
and
he
threw
his
net
hoping
to
catch
something
by
means
of
which
to
obtain
his
subsistenceânow
the
khaleefeh
had
on
a
former
occasion
called
to
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
and
said
to
him
what
was
that
noise
that
i
heard
beneath
the
windows
of
the
palaceâand
he
answered
the
voices
of
the
fishermen
who
are
fishingâso
he
said
go
down
and
forbid
them
from
coming
to
this
place
they
were
therefore
forbidden
to
come
thither
but
this
night
there
came
a
fisherman
named
kereem
and
seeing
the
garden-gate
open
he
said
within
himself
this
is
a
time
of
inadvertence
and
perhaps
i
may
catch
some
fish
on
this
occasionâso
he
took
his
net
and
threw
it
into
the
river
and
then
recited
some
verses
contrasting
the
condition
of
the
poor
fisherman
toiling
throughout
the
night
with
that
of
the
lord
of
the
palace
who
awaking
from
a
pleasant
slumber
findeth
the
fawn
in
his
possession
and
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
recitation
lo
the
khaleefeh
unattended
stood
at
his
head
the
khaleefeh
knew
him
and
exclaimed
o
kereemâand
the
fisherman
hearing
him
call
him
by418
his
name
turned
towards
him
and
when
he
beheld
the
khaleefeh
the
muscles
of
his
side
quivered
and
he
said
by
allah
o
prince
of
the
faithful
i
did
not
this
in
mockery
of
the
mandate
but
poverty
and
the
wants
of
my
family
impelled
me
to
the
act
of
which
thou
art
witness
the
khaleefeh
replied
throw
thy
net
for
my
luck
and
the
fisherman
advanced
rejoicing
exceedingly
and
cast
the
net
and
having
waited
until
it
had
attained
its
limit
and
become
steady
at
the
bottom
drew
it
in
again
and
there
came
up
in
it
a
variety
of
fish
that
could
not
be
numbered

kereem
the
fisherman
the
khaleefeh
was
delighted
at
this
and
said
o
kereem
strip
off
thy
clothesâand
he
did
so
he
was
clad
in
a
jubbeh29
in
which
were
a
hundred
patches
of
coarse
woollen
stuff
containing
vermin
of
the
most
abominable
kind
and
among
them
fleas
in
such
numbers
that
he
might
almost
have
been
transported
by
their
means
over
the
face
of
the
earth
and
he
took
from
his
head
a
turban
which
for
three
years
he
had
never
unwound
but
when
he
happened
to
find
a
piece
of
rag
he
twisted
it
around
it
and
when
he
had
taken
off
the
jubbeh
and
turban
the
khaleefeh
pulled
off
from
his
own
person
two
vests
of
silk
of
alexandria
and
baáºlabekk
and
a
melwaáah30
and
a
farajeeyeh31
and
said
to
the
fisherman
take
these
and
put
them
on
the419
khaleefeh
then
put
on
himself
the
fishermans
jubbeh
and
turban
and
having
drawn
a
lithÃm32
over
his
face
said
to
the
fisherman
go
about
thy
businessâand
he
kissed
the
feet
of
the
khaleefeh
and
thanked
him
reciting
these
two
versesâ

thou
hast
granted
me
favours
beyond
my
power
to
acknowledge
and
completely
satisfied
all
my
wants
i
will
thank
thee
therefore
as
long
as
i
live
and
when
i
die
my
bones
will
thank
thee
in
their
grave33
but
scarcely
had
he
finished
his
verses
when
the
vermin
overran
the
person
of
the
khaleefeh
and
he
began
to
seize
them
with
his
right
hand
and
his
left
from
his
neck
and
to
throw
them
down
and
he
exclaimed
o
fisherman
wo
to
thee
what
are
these
abundant
vermin
in
this
jubbehâo
my
lord
he
answered
at
present
they
torment
thee
but
when
a
week
shall
have
passed
over
thee
thou
wilt
not
feel
them
nor
think
of
them
the
khaleefeh
laughed
and
said
to
him
how
can
i
suffer
this
jubbeh
to
remain
upon
me
the
fisherman
replied
i
wish
to
tell
thee
something
but
i
am
ashamed
through
my
awe
of
the
khaleefeh
impart
said
the
khaleefeh
what
thou
hast
to
tell
me
so
he
said
to
him
it
hath
occurred
to
my
mind
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
thou
desirest
to
learn
the
art
of
fishing
in
order
that
thou
mayest
be
master
of
a
trade
that
may
profit
thee
and
if
such
be
thy
desire
this
jubbeh
is
suitable
to
thee
and
the
khaleefeh
laughed
at
his
words

the
fisherman
then
went
his
way
and
the
khaleefeh
took
the
basket
of
fish
and
having
put
upon
it
a
little
grass
went
with
it
to
jaáºfar
and
stood
before
him
and
jaáºfar
thinking
that
he
was
kereem
the
fisherman
feared
for
him
and
said
o
kereem
what
brought
thee
hither
save
thyself
by
flight
for
the
khaleefeh
is
here
this
nightâand
when
the
khaleefeh
heard
the
words
of
jaáºfar
he
laughed
until
he
fell
down
upon
his
back
so
jaáºfar
said
perhaps
thou
art
our
lord
the
prince
of
the
faithfulâyes
o
jaáºfar
answered
the
khaleefeh
and
thou
art
my
wezeer
and
i
came
with
thee
hither
and
thou
knowest
me
not
how
then
should
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
know
me
when
he
is
drunk
remain
where
thou
art
until
i
return
to
theeâjaáºfar
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
the
khaleefeh
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
palace
and
knocked
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
arose
therefore
and
said
who
is
at
the
door
he
answered
i
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
the
sheykh
said
who
art
thouâand
the
khaleefeh
answered
i
am
kereem
the
fisherman
i
heard
that
there
were
guests
with
thee
and
have
therefore
brought
thee
some
fish
for
it
is420
excellentânow
noor-ed-deen
and
the
damsel
were
both
fond
of
fish
and
when
they
heard
the
mention
of
it
they
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
said
o
my
master
open
to
him
and
let
him
come
in
to
us
with
the
fish
which
he
hath
brought
so
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
opened
the
door
and
the
khaleefeh
in
his
fishermans
disguise
entered
and
began
by
salutation
and
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
said
to
him
welcome
to
the
robber
the
thief
the
gambler
come
hither
and
shew
us
the
fish
which
thou
hast
broughtâhe
therefore
shewed
it
to
them
and
lo
it
was
alive
and
moving
and
the
damsel
exclaimed
by
allah
o
my
master
this
fish
is
excellent
i
wish
it
were
friedâby
allah
said
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
thou
hast
spoken
truth
then
addressing
the
khaleefeh
he
said
o
fisherman
i
wish
thou
hadst
brought
this
fish
fried
arise
and
fry
it
for
us
and
bring
itâon
the
head
be
thy
commands
replied
the
khaleefeh
i
will
fry
it
and
bring
itâbe
quick
said
they
in
doing
it

the
khaleefeh
therefore
arose
and
ran
back
to
jaáºfar
and
said
o
jaáºfar
they
want
the
fish
friedâo
prince
of
the
faithful
replied
he
give
it
me
and
i
will
fry
it
but
the
khaleefeh
said
by
the
tombs
of
my
ancestors
none
shall
fry
it
but
myself
with
my
own
hand
will
i
do
it
he
then
repaired
to
the
hut
of
the
superintendent
and
searching
there
found
in
it
everything
that
he
required
the
frying-pan
and
even
the
salt
and
wild
marjoram
and
other
things
so
he
approached
the
fire-place
and
put
on
the
frying-pan
and
fried
it
nicely
and
when
it
was
done
he
put
it
upon
a
banana-leaf
and
having
taken
from
the
garden
some
limes
he
went
up
with
the
fish
and
placed
it
before
them
the
young
man
therefore
and
the
damsel
and
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
advanced
and
ate
and
when
they
had
finished
they
washed
their
hands
and
noor-ed-deen
said
by
allah
o
fisherman
thou
hast
done
us
a
kindness
this
night
then
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
took
forth
for
him
three
pieces
of
gold
of
those
which
senjer
had
presented
to
him
when
he
was
setting
forth
on
his
journey
and
said
o
fisherman
excuse
me
for
by
allah
if
i
had
known
thee
before
the
events
that
have
lately
happened
to
me
i
would
have
extracted
the
bitterness
of
poverty
from
thy
heart
but
take
this
as
accordant
with
my
present
circumstances
so
saying
he
threw
the
pieces
of
gold
to
the
khaleefeh
who
took
them
and
kissed
them34
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
the
object
of
the
khaleefeh
in
doing
this
was
only
that
he
might
hear
the
damsel
sing
so
he
said
to
him
thou
hast
treated
me
with
beneficence
and
abundantly
recompensed
me
but
i
beg
of
thy
unbounded
indulgence
that
this
damsel421
may
sing
an
air
that
i
may
hear
her
noor-ed-deen
therefore
said
o
enees-el-jelees
she
replied
yesâby
my
life
said
he
sing
to
us
something
for
the
gratification
of
this
fisherman
for
he
desireth
to
hear
thee
and
when
she
had
heard
what
her
master
said
she
took
the
lute
and
tried
it
with
her
fingers
after
she
had
twisted
its
pegs
and
sang
to
it
these
two
versesâ

the
fingers
of
many
a
fawn-like
damsel
have
played
upon
the
lute
and
the
soul
hath
been
ravished
by
the
touch
she
hath
made
the
deaf
to
hear
her
songs
and
the
dumb
hath
exclaimed
thou
hast
excelled
in
thy
singing
enees-el-jelees
playing
on
the
lute
then
she
played
again
in
an
extraordinary
manner
so
as
to
charm
the
minds
of
her
hearers
and
sang
the
following
coupletâ

we
are
honoured
by
your
visiting
our
abode
and
your
splendour
hath
dispelled
the
darkness
of
the
moonless
night
it
is
therefore
incumbent
upon
me
to
perfume
my
dwelling
with
musk
and
rose-water
and
camphor
upon
this
the
khaleefeh
was
affected
with
violent
emotion
and
overcome
by
ecstasy
so
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
from
excessive
delight
and
he
began
to
exclaim
allah
approve
thee
allah
approve
thee
allah
approve
thee
so
noor-ed-deen
said
to
him
o
fisherman
have
the
damsel
and
her
art
in
striking
the
chords
pleased
theeâyea
by
allah
exclaimed
the
khaleefeh
and
noor-ed-deen
immediately
said
she
is
bestowed
upon
thee
as
a
present
from
me
the
present
of
a
generous
man
who
will
not
revoke
his
gift
and
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
took
a
melwaáah
and
threw
it
upon
the
khaleefeh
in
the
fishermans
disguise
ordering
him
to
depart
with
the
damsel
but
she
looked
towards
him
and
said
o
my
master
wilt
thou
part
from
me
without
bidding
me
farewell
if
we
must
be422
separated
pause
while
i
take
leave
of
theeâand
she
recited
the
following
coupletâ

if
you
depart
from
me
still
your
abode
will
be
in
my
heart
in
the
recess
of
my
bosom
i
implore
the
compassionate
to
grant
our
reunion
and
a
boon
such
as
this
god
will
grant
to
whom
he
pleaseth
and
when
she
had
finished
noor-ed-deen
thus
replied
to
herâ

she
bade
me
farewell
on
the
day
of
separation
saying
while
she
wept
from
the
pain
that
it
occasioned
what
wilt
thou
do
after
my
departureâsay
this
i
replied
unto
him
who
will
survive
it
the
khaleefeh
when
he
heard
this
was
distressed
at
the
thought
of
separating
them
and
looking
towards
the
young
man
he
said
to
him
o
my
master
art
thou
in
fear
on
account
of
any
crime
or
art
thou
in
debt
to
any
one
noor-ed-deen
answered
by
allah
o
fisherman
a
wonderful
event
and
an
extraordinary
adventure
happened
to
me
and
this
damsel
if
it
were
engraved
on
the
understanding
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
who
would
be
admonishedâwilt
thou
not
rejoined
the
khaleefeh
relate
to
us
thy
story
and
acquaint
us
with
thy
case
perhaps
thy
doing
so
may
be
productive
of
relief
for
the
relief
of
god
is
nearâso
noor-ed-deen
said
wilt
thou
hear
our
story
in
poetry
or
in
proseâprose
answered
the
khaleefeh
is
mere
talk
and
verse
words
put
together
like
pearls
and
noor-ed-deen
hung
down
his
head
towards
the
ground
and
then
related
his
story
in
a
series
of
verses
but
when
he
had
finished
the
khaleefeh
begged
him
to
explain
his
case
more
fully
he
therefore
acquainted
him
with
the
whole
of
his
circumstances
from
beginning
to

he
said
to

answered

the
khaleefeh
then
said
to
him

school
with

after

prosperity

lot
and
he
became
a
suláÃn
while
god
made
me
to
be
a
fisherman
yet
i
have
never
sent
to

anything
of

hath
performed

he
took

and
on

arrival
in
thy
presence
thou
shalt
divest
thyself
of
the
regal
authority
and
seat
him
in
thy
place

i
have
appointed
him
to
the
office
to
which
i
formerly
appointed
thee
so
disobey
not
my
commands
and
peace

then
gave
the
letter
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
who
took
it
and
kissed
it
and
put
it
in
his
turban
and
immediately
set
forth
on
his
journey

the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
now
looked
towards
the
khaleefeh
in
his
fishermans
disguise
and
said
to
him
o
most
contemptible
of
fishermen
thou
hast
brought
us
two
fish
worth
twenty
half-dirhems35
and
received
three
pieces
of
gold
and
desirest
to
take
the
slave
also
but
when
the
khaleefeh
heard
these
words
he
cried
out
at
him
and
made
a
sign
to
mesroor
who
immediately
discovered
himself
and
rushed
in
upon
him
jaáºfar
meanwhile
had
sent
one
of
the
attendants
of
the
garden
to
the
porter
of
the
palace
to
demand
a
suit
of
clothing
of
him
for
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
the
man
went
and
brought
the
dress
and
kissed
the
ground
before
the
khaleefeh
who
took
off
and
gave
to
him
that
with
which
he
was
then
clad
and
put
on
this
suit
the
sheykh
ibrÃheem
was
sitting
on
a
chair
the
khaleefeh
paused
to
see
the
result
and
the
sheykh
was
astounded
and
began
to
bite
the
ends
of
his
fingers
through
his
confusion
saying
am
i
asleep
or
awake
the
khaleefeh
then
looked
at
him
and
said
o
sheykh
ibrÃheem
what
is
this
predicament
in
which
thou
art
placed
and
upon
this
the
sheykh
recovered
from
his
intoxication
and
throwing
himself
upon
the
ground
implored
forgiveness
and
the
khaleefeh
pardoned
him
after
which
he
gave
orders
that
the
damsel
should
be
conveyed
to
the
palace
where
he
resided
and
when
she
had
arrived
there
he
appropriated
to
her
a
separate
lodging
and
appointed
persons
to
wait
upon
her
and
said
to
her
know
that
i
have
sent
thy
master
as
suláÃn
of
el-baárah
and
if
god
please
i
will
despatch
to
him
a
dress
of
honour
and
send
thee
also
to
him
with
it

as
to
noor-ed-deen
he
continued
his
journey
until
he
entered424
el-baárah
and
went
up
to
the
palace
of
the
suláÃn
when
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
whereupon
the
suláÃn
desired
him
to
approach
and
when
he
came
into
the
presence
of
the
king
he
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
produced
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
him
and
as
soon
as
the
suláÃn
saw
the
superscription
in
the
handwriting
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
having
kissed
it
three
times
said
i
hear
and
pay
obedience
to
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
to
the
prince
of
the
faithful
he
then
summoned
before
him
the
four
áÃáees36
and
the
emeers
and
was
about
to
divest
himself
of
the
regal
office
but
lo
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
was
before
him
and
the
suláÃn
gave
him
the
letter
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
when
he
saw
it
he
rent
it
in
pieces
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
and
chewed
it
and
threw
it
down
the
suláÃn
enraged
cried
wo
to
thee
what
hath
induced
thee
to
act
thusâhe
answered
this
man
hath
had
no
interview
with
the
khaleefeh
nor
with
his
wezeer
but
is
a
young
wretch
an
artful
devil
who
having
met
with
a
paper
containing
the
handwriting
of
the
khaleefeh
hath
counterfeited
it
and
written
what
he
desired
wherefore
then
shouldst
thou
abdicate
the
sovereignty
when
the
khaleefeh
hath
not
sent
to
thee
an
envoy
with
a
royal
autographical
mandate
for
if
this
affair
were
true
he
had
sent
with
him
a
chamberlain
or
a
wezeer
but
he
came
aloneâwhat
then
is
to
be
done
said
the
suláÃn
the
wezeer
answered
send
away
this
young
man
with
me
and
i
will
take
charge
of
him
and
despatch
him
in
company
with
a
chamberlain
to
the
city
of
baghdÃd
and
if
his
words
be
true
he
will
bring
us
a
royal
autographical
mandate
and
diploma
of
investiture
and
if
not
true
they
will
send
him
back
to
us
with
the
chamberlain
and
i
will
take
my
revenge
upon
my
offender

when
the
suláÃn
heard
what
the
wezeer
said
it
pleased
him
and
the
wezeer
took
him
away37
and
cried
out
to
the
pages
who
threw
down
noor-ed-deen
and
beat
him
until
he
became
insensible
he
then
ordered
to
put
a
chain
upon
his
feet
and
called
to
the
jailer
and
when
he
came
he
kissed
the
ground
before
him
this
jailer
was
named
áuáeyá38
and
the
wezeer
said
to
him
o
áuáeyá
i
desire
that
thou
take
this
person
and
cast
him
into
one
of
the
subterranean
cells
which
are
in
thy
prison
and
torture
him
night
and
day
the
jailer
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
put
noor-ed-deen
into
the
prison
and
locked
the
door
upon
him
but
after
having
done
this
he
gave
orders
to
sweep
a
maááabah
within
the
door
and
furnished
it
with
a
prayer-carpet
and
a
pillow
and
seated
noor-ed-deen
upon
it
and425
loosed
his
chain
and
treated
him
with
kindness
the
wezeer
every
day
sent
to
him
commanding
him
to
beat
him
and
the
jailer
pretended
that
he
tortured
him
while
on
the
contrary
he
treated
him
with
benignity

thus
he
continued
to
do
for
forty
days
and
on
the
forty-first
day
there
came
a
present
from
the
khaleefeh
and
when
the
suláÃn
saw
it
it
pleased
him
and
he
conferred
with
the
wezeers
upon
the
subject
but
one
said
perhaps
this
present
was
designed
for
the
new
suláÃn
upon
this
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of
sÃwee
remarked
it
were
proper
to
have
slain
him
on
his
arrivalâand
the
suláÃn
exclaimed
now
thou
hast
reminded
me
of
him
go
down
and
bring
him
and
i
will
strike
off
his
head
the
wezeer
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
arose
saying
i
desire
to
proclaim
throughout
the
city
he
who
wisheth
to
witness
the
decapitation
of
noor-ed-deen
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
let
him
come
to
the
palaceâso
that
all
the
people
may
come
to
behold
it
and
i
may
gratify
my
heart
and
mortify
my
enviers
the
suláÃn
said
do
what
thou
wilt
so
the
wezeer
descended
full
of
joy
and
happiness
and
went
to
the
wÃlee
and
ordered
him
to
make
this
proclamation
and
when
the
people
heard
the
crier
they
all
grieved
and
wept
even
the
boys
in
the
schools
and
the
tradesmen
in
their
shops
and
numbers
of
the
people
strove
together
to
take
for
themselves
places
where
they
might
behold
the
spectacle
while
others
repaired
to
the
prison
to
accompany
him
thence
the
wezeer
then
went
forth
attended
by
ten
memlooks
to
the
prison
and
áuáeyá
the
jailer
said
to
him
what
dost
thou
desire
o
our
lord
the
wezeerâbring
forth
to
me
said
the
wezeer
this
young
wretch
the
jailer
replied
he
is
in
a
most
miserable
state
from
the
excessive
beating
that
i
have
inflicted
upon
him
and
he
entered
and
found
him
reciting
some
verses
commencing
thusâ

who
is
there
to
aid
me
in
my
affliction
for
my
pain
hath
become
intense
and
my
remedy
is
scarce
procurable
and
the
jailer
pulled
off
from
him
his
clean
clothes
and
having
clad
him
in
two
dirty
garments
brought
him
out
to
the
wezeer
noor-ed-deen
then
looked
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
his
enemy
who
had
incessantly
desired
his
destruction
and
when
he
beheld
him
he
wept
and
said
to
him
art
thou
secure
from
misfortune
hast
thou
not
heard
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

they
made
use
of
their
power
and
used
it
tyrannically
and
soon
it
became
as
though
it
never
had
existed
o
wezeer
know
that
god
whose
perfection
be
extolled
and
whose426
name
be
exalted
is
the
doer
of
whatsover
he
willethâo
alee
replied
the
wezeer
wouldst
thou
frighten
me
by
these
words
i
am
now
going
to
strike
off
thy
head
in
spite
of
the
people
of
el-baárah
and
i
will
pay
no
regard
to
thy
counsel
but
i
will
rather
attend
to
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

let
fortune
do
whatever
it
willeth
and
bear
with
cheerful
mind
the
effects
of
fate
how
excellent
also
is
the
saying
of
another
poetâ

he
who
liveth
after
his
enemy
a
single
day
hath
attained
his
desire
the
wezeer
then
ordered
his
pages
to
convey
him
on
the
back
of
a
mule
whereupon
they
said
to
him
being
distressed
to
obey
suffer
us
to
stone
him
and
cut
him
in
pieces
though
our
lives
should
be
sacrificed
in
consequence
but
he
replied
never
do
it
have
ye
not
heard
what
the
poet
hath
saidâ

a
decreed
term
is
my
inevitable
lot
and
as
soon
as
its
days
have
expired
i
die
if
the
lions
dragged
me
into
their
forest
they
could
not
close
it
while
aught
of
it
remained
so
they
proceeded
to
proclaim
before
noor-ed-deen
this
is
the
smallest
recompense
of
him
who
forgeth
a
letter
from
the
khaleefeh
to
the
suláÃn
and
they
continued
to
parade
him
throughout
el-baárah
until
they
stationed
him
beneath
the
window
of
the
palace
and
in
the
place
of
blood39
when
the
executioner
approached
him
and
said
to
him
i
am
a
slave
under
command
and
if
thou
hast
any
want
acquaint
me
with
it
that
i
may
perform
it
for
thee
for
there
remaineth
not
of
thy
life
any
more
than
the
period
until
the
suláÃn
shall
put
forth
his
face
from
the
window
and
upon
this
noor-ed-deen
looked
to
the
right
and
left
and
recited
these
versesâ

is
there
among
you
a
merciful
friend
who
will
aid
me
i
conjure
you
by
allah
to
answer
me
my
life
hath
passed
and
my
death
is
at
hand
is
there
any
who
will
pity
me
to
obtain
my
recompense40
and
consider
my
state
and
relieve
my
anguish
by
a
draught
of
water
that
my
torment
may
be
lightened
and
the
people
were
excited
to
tears
for
him
and
the
executioner
took
some
water
to
hand
it
to
him
but
the
wezeer
arose
from
his
place
and
struck
the
áulleh41
of
water
with
his
hand
and
broke
it
and
called
to
the
executioner
commanding
him
to
strike
off
his
head
whereupon
he
bound
noor-ed-deens
eyes
the
people
however
called
out
against
the
wezeer
and
raised
a
tumultuous
cry
against
him
and
many
words
passed
between
them
and
while
they
were
in
this
state427
lo
a
dust
rose
and
filled
the
sky
and
the
open
tracts
and
when
the
suláÃn
beheld
it
as
he
sat
in
the
palace
he
said
to
his
attendants
see
what
is
the
news
the
wezeer
said
after
thou
shalt
first
have
beheaded
this
man
but
the
suláÃn
replied
wait
thou
until
we
see
what
is
the
news

enees-el-jelees
and
the
khaleefeh
and
jaafar
now
this
dust
was
the
dust
of
jaáºfar
the
wezeer
of
the
khaleefeh
and
of
his
attendants
and
the
cause
of
their
coming
was
thisâthe
khaleefeh
had
passed
thirty
days
without
remembering
the
affair
of
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
no
one
mentioned
it
to
him
until
he
came
one
night
to
the
private
apartment
of
enees-el-jelees
and
heard
her
lamenting
as
she
recited
with
a
soft
voice
the
saying
of
the
poetâ

thine
image
is
before
me
whether
distant
or
near
and
my
tongue
never
ceaseth
to
mention
thee
her
lamentation
increased
and
lo
the
khaleefeh
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
chamber
and
saw
enees-el-jelees
weeping
on
beholding
the
khaleefeh
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
having
kissed
them
three
times
recited
these
two
verses428â

o
thou
of
pure
origin
and
of
excellent
birth
of
ripe-fruitful
branch
and
of
unsullied
race
i
remind
thee
of
the
promise
thy
beneficence
granted
and
far
be
it
from
thee
that
thou
shouldst
forget
it
the
khaleefeh
said
to
her
who
art
thou
she
answered
i
am
the
present
given
to
thee
by
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
i
request
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
which
thou
gavest
me
that
thou
wouldst
send
me
to
him
with
the
honorary
gift
for
i
have
now
been
here
thirty
days
and
have
not
tasted
sleep
and
upon
this
the
khaleefeh
summoned
jaáºfar
el-barmekee
and
said
to
him
for
thirty
days
i
have
heard
no
news
of
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn
and
i
imagine
nothing
less
than
that
the
suláÃn
hath
killed
him
but
by
my
head
by
the
tombs
of
my
ancestors
if
any
evil
event
hath
happened
to
him
i
will
destroy
him
who
hath
been
the
cause
of
it
though
he
be
the
dearest
of
men
in
my
estimation
i
desire
therefore
that
thou
journey
immediately
to
el-baárah
and
bring
me
an
account
of
the
conduct
of
the
king
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn
ez-zeynee
to
alee
the
son
of
el-faál
the
son
of
khÃáÃn

so
jaáºfar
obeyed
his
commands
and
set
forth
on
his
journey
and
when
he
approached
and
saw
this
tumult
and
crowd
he
said
what
is
the
occasion
of
this
crowd
they
related
to
him
therefore
the
situation
in
which
they
were
with
regard
to
noor-ed-deen
and
when
he
heard
their
words
he
hastened
to
go
up
to
the
suláÃn
and
having
saluted
him
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
of
his
coming
and
told
him
that
if
any
evil
event
had
happened
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
the
khaleefeh
would
destroy

they
performed
the
morning-prayers
and
mounted
all
together
with
the
wezeer
el-moeen
the
son
of

who
now
repented
of
what
he
had
done
as
to
alee
noor-ed-deen
he
rode
by
the
side
of
jaáºfar
and
they
continued
their
journey
until
they
arrived
at
baghdÃd
the
abode
of
peace429

they
then
presented
themselves
before
the
khaleefeh
and
related
to
him
the
case
of
noor-ed-deen
whereupon
the
khaleefeh
addressed
him
saying
take
this
sword
and
strike
off
with
it
the
head
of
thine
enemy
and
he
took
it
and
approached
el-moeen
the
son
of

but
he
looked
at
him
and
said
to
him
i
did
according
to
my
nature
and
do
thou
according
to
thine
and
noor-ed-deen
threw
down
the
sword
from
his
hand
and
looking
towards
the
khaleefeh
said
o
prince
of
the
faithful
he
hath
beguiled
me
so
the
khaleefeh
said
do
thou
leave
himâand
he
said
to

o

advance
thou
and
strike
off

the

respecting
murder
and

homicide
the

ordains
that

punished
with

or
rather
that
the
free
shall
die
for
the
free
the
slave
for
the

and
a

for

or
that
the
perpetrator
of

crime
shall
pay
to
the
heirs
of
the
person
whom
he
has
killed
if
they
will
allow
it
a
fine
which
is
to
be
divided
according
to
the
laws
of
inheritance346
it
also
ordains
that
unintentional
homicide
shall
be
expiated
by
freeing
a
believer
from
slavery
and
paying
to
the
family
of
the
person
killed
a
fine
unless
they
remit
it347
but
these
laws
are
amplified
and
explained
by
the
same
book
and
by
the
imÃmsâa
fine
is
not
to
be
accepted
for
murder
unless
the
crime
has
been

by
some
palliating

the
accomplices
of
a
murderer
are
liable
to
the
punishment
of
death
by
the

also
a
man
is
obnoxious
to
capital
punishment
for
the
murder
of
a
woman
and
by
the
áanafee
law
for
the
murder
of
another
mans
slave
but
he
is
exempted
from
this
punishment
who
kills
his
own

descendant

his
own

or
his
sons
slave
or
a
slave
of
whom
he
is
part-owner
so
also
are
his
accomplices
and
according
to
esh-shÃfeee
a
muslim
though
a
slave
is
not
to
be
put
to
death
for
killing
an
infidel
though
the
latter
be
free
a
man
who
kills
another
in
self-defence
or
to
defend
his
property
from
a
robber
is
exempt
from
all
punishment
the
price
of
blood
is
a
debt
incumbent
on
the
family
tribe
or
association
of
which
the
homicide
is
a
member
it
is
also
incumbent
on
the
inhabitants
of
an
enclosed
quarter
or
the
proprietor
or
proprietors
of
a
field
in
which
the
body
of
a
person
killed
by
an
unknown
hand
is
found
unless
the
person
has
been
found
killed
in
his
own
house

hence
it
appears
that
the
punishment
with
which
the
wezeer
el-faál
threatened
his
son
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
grave
criminal
act
especially
when
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
sons
offence
for
the
slave
was
the
property
of
the
king
and
it
was
not
allowable
to
any
other
man
even
to
see
her
without
his
permission
many
of
the
characters
depicted
in
the
present
work
would
seem
incongruous
in
the
extreme
if
judged
according
to
european
notions
of
justice
and
other
moral
qualities

generally
repeated
by
a

muslim

note

this
is
said
to
imply
as
my
sheykh
has
remarked
in
a
marginal
note
that
el-faál
was
a
charitable
person
who
bestowed
pensions
upon
the
professors
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
of
science
there
are
many
among
the

do
so

the
washing

and
burial
of
the
dead
the
ceremonies
attendant
upon
death
and
burial
are
nearly
the

in
the
cases
of
men
and
women
the
face
or
the
head
of
the
dying
person
is
turned
towards
the
direction
of
mekkeh
when
the
spirit
is
departing
the
eyes
are
closed
and
then
or
immediately
after
the
women
of
the
house
commence
a
loud
lamentation
in
which
many
of
the
females
of
the
neighbourhood
generally
come
to
join
hired
female
mourners
are
also
usually
employed
each
of
whom
accompanies
her
exclamations
of
alas
for
him
c
by
beating
a
tambourine
if
possible
the
corpse
is
buried
on
the
day
of
the
death
but
when
this
cannot
be
done
the
lamentation
of
the
women
is
continued
during
the
ensuing
night
and
a
recitation
of
several
chapters
or
of
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
is
performed
by
one
or
more
men
hired
for
the
purpose

the
washing
consists
first
in
the
performance
of
the
ordinary
ablution
which
is
preparatory
to
prayer
with
the
exception
of
the
cleansing
of
the
mouth
and
nose
and
secondly
in
an
ablution
of
the
whole
body
with
warm
water
and
soap
or
with
water
in
which
some
leaves
of
the
lote-tree
have
been
boiled
the
jaw
is
bound
up
the
eyes
are
closed

the
nostrils

are
stuffed

the
corpse
is
sprinkled
with
a
mixture
of
water

pounded
leaves
of
the
lote-tree

sometimes
other
dried
and
pulverized
leaves
c
and
with
rose-water
the
ankles
are
bound
together
and
the
hands
placed
upon
the
breast

the
grave-clothing
of
a
poor
man
consists
of
a
piece
or
two
of
cotton
or
a
kind
of
bag
but
the
corpse
of
a
man
of
wealth
is
generally
wrapped
first
in
muslin
then
in
cotton
cloth
of
a
thicker
texture

in
a
piece
of
striped
stuff
of
silk

in
a
áafáÃn
a
long
vest
of
similar
stuff
merely
stitched
together
and
over
these
is
wrapped
a
kashmeer
shawl
the
colours
most
approved
for
the
grave-clothes
are
white
and
green
the
body
thus
shrouded
is
placed
in
a
bier
which
is
usually
covered
with
a
kashmeer
shawl
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
three
or
four
men
generally
friends
of
the
deceased432

there
are
some
slight
differences
in
the
funeral-ceremonies
observed
in
different
arab
countries
but
a
sufficient
notion
of
them
will
be
conveyed
by
briefly
describing
those
which
prevail
in
cairo
the
procession
to
the

is
generally
headed
by
a
number
of
poor
men
mostly
blind

two
professions
of

above
in

or
sometimes
other
words
they
are
usually
followed
by
some
male
relations
and
friends
of
the

and
these
by
a
group
of
schoolboys
chanting
in
a
higher

one
of

my

remarks
that
this

said
merely
to
excite
men
to
generosity

literally
it

is
shown
by
the
memorable
example
of

son
of

preferred
giving
the
water
with
which
he
was
provided

we
are
not
to
understand
that
such
a

as
enees-el-jelees
was
exposed
to
the
public
gaze
in
a
market
to
which
all
persons
indiscriminately
were
admitted
for
this
would
be
at
variance
with
eastern
usages

in
a

mart
to

none
were

persons
of

who
expressed

kissing
the
ground
as
a
mode
of
obeisance
this
and
several
other
passages
in
the
present
work
shew
that
we
are
often
to
understand
the
expression
kissing
the
ground
before
a
person
as
signifying
touching
the
ground
and
then
the
lips
and
forehead
or
turban
with
the
right
hand
and
i
believe
this
expression
should
generally
be
so
understood
when
i
wrote
the
fourteenth
note
to
the
introduction
i
inclined
to
a
contrary
opinion
chiefly
from
recollecting
to
have
read
the
following
translation
of
a
passage
of

by
the
learned

but
on
referring
to
the
original
i
find
that
the
words
which
he
renders
cette
coutume
de
se
prosterner
signify
literally
the
bending
towards
the
ground
i
suppose
therefore
that
his
deviating
from
the
literal
sense
in
one
case
was
owing
to
his
adhering
to
it
in
another
and
not
meeting
with
the
proof
which
i
had
fancied
to
exist
of
his
being
right
i
venture
to
differ
from
him
in
this
instance
without
fear
of
being
suspected
of
arrogance
as
the
kind
of
obeisance
above
described
is
often
called
kissing
the
ground
both
by
the
arabs
and
the
persians
i
should
add
that
except
in
the
house
i
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
seen
the
ground
actually
touched
but
nearly
so
in
making
this
obeisance
which
is
still
called
kissing
the
ground
when
thus
imperfectly
performed

known
by

where
complainants
of
injustice
used
to
station
themselves

it
was
a
custom
of
the
khaleefeh
to
sit
there
every
night
for
those
of
the
complainants
of
injustice
who
might
come
to
him
when
any
one
therefore
was
wronged
he
would
stand
under
the
saáeefeh

say

voice
there
is
no

god
moáammad
is

intrust
his

shaving
the
head
i
do
not
know
when
the
custom
of
shaving
the
head
became
general
among
the
arabs
of
the
towns
but
from
a
remark
of
es-suyooáee
i
think
it
was
not
so
common
about
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
century
of
the
flight
that
is
about
the
period
which
this
work
best
illustrates
as
it
is
at
present
when
it
is
almost
universal
among
all
classes
for
in
his
time
its
legality
was
doubted
he
writes
thusâthe
imÃn
el-ghazÃlee
hath
said
there
is
no
harm
in
it
in
the
case
of
him
whose
object
is
cleanliness
and
the
apparent
sense
of
his
words
is
that
it
is
improper
in
him
who
desireth
to
beautify
himself
for
any
worldly
purpose
as
is
done
by
people
of
bad
disposition352
it
is
added
in
a
marginal
note
in
the
copy
from
which
i
translate
this
persons
differ
respecting
the
shaving
of
the
head
the
opinion
generally
prevailing
is
that
it
is
improper
to
him
who
wears
not
a
turban
and
allowable
to
him
who
does
wear
one
since
he
has
a
substituteâthat
it
is
also
lawful
unquestionably
in
the
case
of
any
disease
of
the
headâand
that
the
hanging
of
the
rosary
to
the
neck
and
the
shaving
of
the
head
without
a
legal
necessity
are
innovationsâhÃroon
er-rasheed
generally
wore
the
hair
of
his
head
sufficiently
long
to
reach
below
his
ears
but
shaved
it
when
he
performed
the
pilgrimage353
and
many
other
muslims
in
early
times
did
the
same
those
who
shave
the
head
generally
leave
a
small
tuft
upon
the
crown

most
persons
of

others
disapprove
of
this
tuft

the
story
of
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love

it
hath
been
told
me
o
happy
king
said
shahrazÃd
that
there
was
in
ancient
times
a
certain
merchant
of
damascus1
possessed
of
wealth
who
had
a
son
like
the
moon
at
the
full
of
eloquent
tongue
called
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob2
the
distracted
slave
of
love
and
this
son
had
a
sister
named
fitneh3
on
account
of
her
excessive
beauty
and
loveliness
their
father
died
leaving
them
large
property
among
which
were
a
hundred
loads4
of
silk
and
brocade
and
bags5
of
musk
and
upon
these
loads
was
written
this
is
intended
for
baghdÃdâit
having
been
his
desire
to
journey
to
that
city

so
when
god
whose
name
be
exalted
had
taken
his
soul
and437
some
time
had
elapsed
his
son
took
these
loads
and
journeyed
with
them
to
baghdÃdâthis
was
in
the
time
of
hÃroon
er-rasheedâhe
took
leave
of
his
mother
and
relations
and
townspeople
before
his
departure
and
went
forth
placing
his
dependence
upon
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
god
decreed
him
safety
so
that
he
arrived
at
baghdÃd
whither
there
travelled
in
his
company
a
party
of
merchants
he
hired
for
himself
a
handsome
house
and
furnished
it
with
carpets
and
cushions
and
suspended
curtains
in
it
and
there
he
deposited
those
loads
together
with
the
mules
and
camels
and
remained
until
he
had
rested
himself
and
the
merchants
of
baghdÃd
and
its
great
men
came
and
saluted
him
he
then
took
a
wrapper
containing
ten
pieces
of
costly
stuff
with
the
prices
written
upon
them
and
went
forth
with
them
to
the
market
of
the
merchants
who
met
him
and
saluted
him
treated
him
with
honour
and
welcomed
him
and
seated
him
at
the
shop
of
the
sheykh
of
the
market
and
he
sold
the
pieces
gaining
for
every
piece
of
gold
two
so
ghÃnim
rejoiced
and
he
proceeded
to
sell
the
stuffs
by
little
and
little
and
continued
to
do
so
for
a
whole
year

after
this
on
the
first
day
of
the
following
year
he
came
to
the
same
market
but
found
its
gate
shut
and
inquiring
the
cause
of
this
he
was
answered
one
of
the
merchants
hath
died
and
all
the
rest
of
them
have
gone
to
walk
in
his
funeral-procession
wilt
thou
then
added
his
informant
gain
a
recompense6
by
walking
with
themâhe
replied
yesâand
he
asked
respecting
the
place
of
the
funeral
so
they
guided
him
thither
and
he
performed
the
ablution7
and
walked
with
the
other
merchants
until
they
arrived
at
the
place
of
prayer
where
they
prayed
over
the
dead
the
merchants
then
walked
all
together
before
the
corpse
to
the
burial-ground
ghÃnim
following
them
until
the
procession
arrived
at
the
burial-ground
outside
the
city
and
they
proceeded
among
the
tombs
until
they
came
to
that
in
which
the
corpse
was
to
be
deposited
they
found
that
the
family
of
the
deceased
had
pitched
a
tent
over
the
tomb
and
placed
there
the
candles
and
lamps
and
they
buried
the
dead
and
the
readers
sat
reciting
the
áur-Ãn
at
the
tomb
the
merchants
sat
with
them
and
so
also
did
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
but
he
was
overcome
by
bashfulness
saying
within
himself
i
cannot
quit
them
until
i
have
departed
with
them
they
sat
listening
to
the
recitation
of
the
áur-Ãn
until
the
period
of
nightfall
when
the
servants
placed
before
them
the
supper
and
sweetmeats
and
they
ate
till
they
were
satisfied
and
washed
their
hands
and
resumed
their
seats438

the
heart
of
ghÃnim
was
now
troubled
with
reflections
upon
his
merchandize
and
he
was
fearful
of
the
thieves
and
said
within
himself
i
am
a
stranger
and
suspected
of
possessing
wealth
and
if
i
pass
the
night
far
away
from
my
abode
the
thieves
will
steal
the
money
and
the
loads
so
fearing
for
his
property
he
arose
and
went
forth
from
among
the
company
asking
their
leave
to
depart
on
account
of
some
business
that
he
had
to
transact
and
followed
the
beaten
track
until
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
city
but
it
was
then
midnight
and
he
found
the
gate
of
the
city
shut
and
saw
no
one
coming
or
going
and
heard
not
a
sound
save
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
whereupon
he
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
i
was
in
fear
for
my
property
and
came
hither
on
account
of
it
and
have
found
the
gate
shut
and
now
i
have
become
in
fear
for
my
lifeâhe
then
returned
to
seek
for
himself
a
place
in
which
to
sleep
until
the
morning
and
finding
a
private
burial-place
enclosed
by
four
walls
with
a
palm-tree
within
it
and
a
gate-way
of
hard
stone
open
he
entered
it
and
desired
to
sleep
but
sleep
came
not
to
him

tremor
and
gloom
overcame
him
thus
lying
among
the
tombs
and
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
opening
the
door
looked
out
and
beheld
a
light
gleaming
in
the
distance
in
the
direction
of
the
city-gate
he
advanced
a
few
steps
and
saw
the
light
approaching
in
the
way
which
led
to
the
burial-place
in
which
he
was
taking
refuge
whereupon
ghÃnim
feared
for
himself
and
hastily
closed
the
door
and
climbed
up
into
the
palm-tree
and
concealed
himself
in
the
midst
of
its
branches
the
light
continued
to
approach
the
tomb
by
little
and
little
until
it
came
very
near
and
as
he
looked
attentively
at
it
he
perceived
three
black
slaves
two
of
whom
were
bearing
a
chest
the
other
having
in
his
hand
an
adze
and
a
lantern
and
as
they
drew
near
one
of
the
two
slaves
who

what
aileth
thee
o
áawÃb8âto
which
the
other
of
the
two
replied
what
aileth
thee
o
kÃfoor9
the
former
rejoined
were
we
not
here
at
the
hour
of
nightfall
and
did
we
not
leave
the
door
openâyes
answered
the
other
what
thou
sayest
is
trueâsee
then
resumed
the
first
speaker
it
is
shut
and
barredâupon
this
the
third
who
was
carrying
the
adze
and
light
and
whose
name
was
bakheet10
said
how
small
is
your
sense
know
ye
not
that
the
owners
of
the
gardens
go
forth
from
baghdÃd
and
repair
hither
and
evening
overtaking
them
enter
this
place
and
shut
the
door
upon
themselves
through
fear
lest
the
blacks
like
ourselves
should
take
them
and
roast
them
and
eat439
them11âthou
hast
spoken
truth
they
answered
but
there
is
none
among
us
of
less
sense
than
thyselfâverily
he
replied
ye
will
not
believe
me
until
we
enter
the
burial-place
and
find
some
one
in
it
and
i
imagine
that
if
any
one
be
in
it
and
have
seen
the
light
he
hath
betaken
himself
to
the
top
of
the
palm-tree

ghÃnim
in
the
palm-tree
when
ghÃnim
heard
these
words
of
the
slave
he
said
within
himself
how
cunning
is
this
slave
may
allah
disgrace
the
blacks
for
their
malice
and
villainy
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
what
will
deliver
me
from
this
difficultyâthe
two
who
were
bearing
the
chest
then
said
to
him
who
had
the
adze
climb
over
the
wall
and
open
to
us
the
door
o
bakheet
for
we
are
fatigued
with
carrying
the
chest
upon
our
necks
and
if
thou
open
to
us
the
door
we
will
give
thee
one
of
the
persons
whom
we
take
and
we
will
fry
him
for
thee
excellently
so
that
not
a
drop
of
his
fat
shall
be
lost
but
he
replied
i
am
afraid
of
a
thing
that
my
little
sense
hath
suggested
to
me
let
us
throw
over
the
chest
behind
the
door
for
it
is
our
deposite
they
said
to
him
if
we
throw
it
it440
will
breakâi
am
afraid
he
rejoined
that
there
may
be
within
the
tomb
robbers
who
slay
men
and
steal
their
property
for
when
evening
overtaketh
them
they
enter
these
places
to
divide
what
they
have
takenâo
thou
of
little
sense
exclaimed
the
two
others
can
they
enter
hereâthey
then
put
down
the
chest
and
climbed
up
the
wall
and
descended
and
opened
the
door
while
the
third
slave
bakheet
stood
waiting
for
them
with
the
light
and
a
basket
containing
some
plaster
after
which
they
seated
themselves
having
closed
the
door
and
one
of
them
said
o
my
brother
we
are
tired
with
walking
and
taking
up
and
putting
down
and
opening
the
door
and
shutting
it
and
it
is
now
midnight
and
we
have
not
strength
remaining
to
open
the
tomb
and
to
bury
the
chest
wherefore
we
will
sit
here
three
hours
to
rest
ourselves
and
then
rise
and
accomplish
our
business
but
each
of
us
shall
in
the
mean
time
tell
his
story
and
relate
all
that
hath
happened
to
him
from
beginning
to
end
so
the
first
who
carried
the
light
told
his
story
but
it
was
of
a
nature
unfit
to
be
here
repeated12
after
which
another
of
the
slaves
thus
began

the
story
of
the
slave
kÃfoor13

know
o
my
brothers
that
i
was
at
the
commencement
of
my
career
a
boy
of
eight
years
and
i
used
to
tell
one
lie
to
the
slave-merchants
every
year
so
that
they
fell
out
with
each
other
in
consequence
and
the
slave-merchant
my
master
becoming
impatient
of
me
committed
me
to
the
broker
desiring
him
to
cry
who
will
buy
this
slave
with
his
fault
he
was
therefore
asked
what
is
his
faultâand
answered
he
telleth
one
lie
every
year
and
a
merchant
approached
the
broker
and
said
to
him
how
much
have
they
bidden
for
this
slave
with
his
fault
he
answered
they
have
bidden
six
hundred
pieces
of
silverâthen
thou
shalt
have
twenty
for
thyself
replied
the
merchant
so
the
broker
introduced
him
to
the
slave-merchant
who
received
from
him
the
money
and
the
broker
conveyed
me
to
the
dwelling
of
the
merchant
and
took
his
brokerage

the
merchant
clad
me
in
a
dress
suitable
to
my
condition
and
i
continued
with
him
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
until
the
new
year
commenced
with
prosperity
it
was
a
blessed
year
plenteous
in
the
produce
of
the
earth
and
the
merchants
began
to
give
entertainments
every
day
one
taking
his
turn
to
do
so
until
it
was
my
masters
turn
to
give
an
entertainment
in
a
garden
within
the
city
so
he
went441
and
the
other
merchants
also
and
he
took
for
them
what
they
required
of
food
and
other
provisions
and
they
sat
eating
and
drinking
and
carousing
till
noon
when
my
master
wanted
something
from
the
house
and
said
o
slave
mount
the
mule
and
go
to
the
house
and
bring
from
thy
mistress
such
a
thing
and
return
quickly

i
obeyed
therefore
and
went
to
the
house
but
when
i
approached
it
i
shrieked
out
and
shed
tears
whereupon
the
people
of
the
quarter
assembled
together
old
and
young
and
my
masters
wife
and
daughters
hearing
my
cry
opened
the
door
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
answered
them
my
master
was
sitting
beneath
an
old
wall
he
and
his
friends
and
it
fell
upon
them
and
when
i
beheld
what
happened
to
them
i
mounted
the
mule
and
came
in
haste
to
inform
you
and
when
his
children
and
wife
heard
these
words
they
shrieked
and
tore
their
clothes
and
slapped
their
faces
and
the
neighbours
came
to
them
then
my
masters
wife
overturned
the
furniture
of
the
house
one
thing
upon
another
and
pulled
down
its
shelves
and
broke
its
shutters
and
its
windows
and
smeared
its
walls
with
mud
and
indigo
and
said
to
me
wo
to
thee
o
kÃfoor
come
hither
and
help
me
and
demolish
these
cupboards
and
smash
these
vessels
and
this
china-wareâso
i
went
to
her
and
destroyed
with
her
the
shelves
of
the
house
and
all
that
was
upon
them
and
its
cupboards
and
what
they
contained
and
went
about
over
the
terraces
and
through
every
place
until
i
had
laid
waste
the
whole
crying
all
the
while
oh
my
master
my
mistress
then
went
forth
with
her
face
uncovered
and
only
with
her
head-veil
and
the
girls
and
boys
went
with
her
saying
to
me
o
kÃfoor
walk
on
before
us
and
shew
us
the
place
where
thy
master
lieth
dead
beneath
the
wall
that
we
may
take
him
forth
from
under
the
ruins
and
carry
him
in
a
bier
and
bring
him
to
the
house
and
convey
his
corpse
in
a
handsome
manner
to
the
burial
so
i
walked
before
them
crying
oh
my
masterâand
they
followed
me
with
their
faces
and
heads
uncovered14
crying
oh
our
misfortune
oh
our
calamityâand
there
was
none
among
the
men
nor
among
the
women
nor
among
the
children
nor
a
maiden
nor
an
old
woman
in
the
quarter
who
did
not
accompany
us
and
all
of
them
slapped
themselves
in
the
excess
of
their
lamentation
thus
i
went
with
them
through
the
city
and
the
people
asking
the
news
they
informed
them
of
that
which
they
had
heard
from
me
and
the
people
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
we
will
go
to
the
wÃlee
and
acquaint
himâand
when
they
arrived
before
the
wÃlee
they
informed
him
and
he
mounted442
and
took
with
him
labourers
with
axes
and
baskets
and
they
followed
my
footsteps
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
people

i
preceded
them
weeping
and
crying
out
and
throwing
dust
upon
my
head
and
slapping
my
face
and
when
i
came
to
the
party
in
the
garden
and
my
master
beheld
me
i
slapped
my
face
and
exclaimed
oh
my
mistress
who
will
have
pity
upon
me
after
my
mistress
would
that
i
had
been
her
sacrificeâwhen
my
master
therefore
saw
me
he
was
confounded
his
countenance
became
pale
and
he
said
what
aileth
thee
o
kÃfoor
and
what
is
this
predicament
and
what
is
the
news
i
answered
him
when
thou
sentest
me
to
the
house
to
bring
thee
what
thou
wantedst
i
went
thither
and
entered
the
house
and
found
that
the
wall
of
the
saloon
had
fallen
and
that
the
whole
saloon
had
tumbled
down
upon
my
mistress
and
her
childrenâand
did
not
thy
mistress
said
he
escape
i
answered
no
not
one
of
them
escaped
and
the
first
of
them
that
died
was
my
mistress
the
elderâbut
did
my
youngest
daughter
escape
he
asked
i
answered
noâand
what
said
he
hath
become
of
the
mule
that
i
ride
is
she
safeâno
o
my
master
i
answered
for
the
walls
of
the
house
and
the
walls
of
the
stable
tumbled
down
upon
all
that
was
in
the
house
even
upon
the
sheep
and
the
geese
and
the
hens
and
all
of
them
became
a
mass
of
flesh
beneath
the
ruins
not
one
of
them
escaped
he
then
said
to
me
and
thy
master
the
elder
i
answered
no
not
one
escaped
and
now
there
remains
neither
house
nor
inhabitant
nor
any
trace
of
them
and
as
to
the
sheep
and
the
geese
and
the
hens
the
cats
and
dogs
have
now
eaten
themâand
when
my
master
heard
my
words
the
light
became
darkness
before
his
face
and
he
was
no
longer
master
of
his
senses
nor
of
his
reason
and
was
unable
to
stand
upon
his
feet
he
was
paralyzed
and
the
strength
of
his
back
failed
him
and
he
rent
his
clothes
and
plucked
his
beard
and
slapped
his
face
and
threw
his
turban
from
his
head
and
ceased
not
to
slap
his
face
until
the
blood
flowed
from
it
and
he
began
to
cry
ah
oh
my
children
ah
oh
my
wife
ah
oh
my
misfortune
unto
whom
hath
happened
the
like
of
that
which
hath
happened
to
meâthe
merchants
also
his
companions
joined
with
him
in
cries
and
lamentations
and
were
moved
with
pity
for
his
case
and
rent
their
clothes
and
my
master
went
forth
from
the
garden
beating
himself
for
the
calamity
that
had
as
he
supposed
befallen
him
and
redoubled
the
blows
upon
his
face
seeming
as
though
he
were
drunk

and
as
the
party
thus
went
out
from
the
gate
of
the
garden
they
beheld
a
great
dust
and
heard
tumultuous
cries
and
looking
in
that443
direction
saw
the
crowd
approaching
them
this
crowd
was
the
wÃlee
and
his
attendants
and
a
concourse
of
people
who
had
come
to
gratify
their
curiosity
with
the
merchants
family
behind
them
shrieking
and
crying
with
violent
lamentation
and
excessive
grief
and
the
first
who
accosted
my
master
were
his
wife
and
children
on
beholding
these
he
was
confounded
and
laughed
and
said
to
them
how
are
ye
and
what
hath
happened
to
you
in
the
house
and
what
hath
befallen
you
and
when
they
saw
him
they
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
for
thy
safety
and
they
threw
themselves
upon
him
and
his
children
clung
to
him
crying
out
oh
our
father
praise
be
to
god
for
thy
safety
o
our
fatherâand
his
wife
said
to
him
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
shewn
us
thy
face
in
safetyâand
she
was
stupified
and
her
reason
fled
from
her
at
that
which
she
beheld
she
then
said
to
him
how
didst
thou
escape
with
thy
friendsâand
how
said
he
were
ye
in
the
houseâwe
were
all
well
they
answered
in
prosperity
and
health
and
no
evil
hath
befallen
our
house
save
that
thy
slave
kÃfoor
came
to
us
with
his
head
uncovered
and
his
clothes
rent
crying
out
oh
my
master
oh
my
masterâand
we
said
to
him
what
is
the
matter
o
kÃfoorâand
he
answered
my
master
was
sitting
under
a
wall
in
the
garden
and
it
fell
upon
him
and
he
diedâby
allah
replied
my
master
he
came
to
me
just
now
crying
oh
my
mistress
oh
the
children
of
my
mistressâand
said
my
mistress
and
her
children
are
all
dead

the
merchant
meeting
his
family
he
then
looked
aside
and
seeing
me
with
my
turban
falling
from
my
head
while
i
still
cried
out
and
wept
violently
and
threw
dust
upon
my
head
he
called
out
to
me
so
i
approached
him
and
he
said
to
me
wo
to
thee
o
malevolent
slave
o
misbegotten
wretch
o
thou
of
accursed
race
what
events
hast
thou
brought
about
but444
by
allah
i
will
strip
off
thy
skin
from
thy
flesh
and
cut
thy
flesh
from
thy
bonesâby
allah
replied
i
thou
canst
not
do
to
me
anything
for
thou
boughtest
me
with
my
fault
on
this
condition
the
witnesses
testifying
that
thou
boughtest
me
with
my
fault
thou
knowing
it
and
it
was
that
i
was
accustomed
to
tell
one
lie
every
year
and
this
is
but
half
a
lie
and
when
the
year
is
complete
i
will
tell
the
other
half
of
it
so
it
will
be
an
entire
lie
but
upon
this
he
cried
out
at
me
o
most
accursed
of
slaves
is
this
but
half
a
lie
nay
it
is
an
exceeding
calamity
depart
from
me
for
thou
art
free15âby
allah
i
replied
if
thou
liberate
me
i
will
not
liberate
thee
until
the
year
be
complete
and
i
tell
the
remaining
half
of
the
lie
and
when
i
have
completed
it
then
take
me
to
the
market
and
sell
me
as
thou
boughtest
me
with
my
fault
and
liberate
me
not
for
i
have
no
trade
by
means
of
which
to
procure
my
subsistence
this
is
a
legal
proposition
that
i
have
stated
to
thee
laid
down
by
the
lawyers
in
the
chapter
of
emancipation16âwhile
we
were
thus
talking
the
crowd
approached
with
the
people
of
the
quarter
women
and
men
come
to
mourn
and
the
wÃlee
with
his
attendants
and
my
master
and
the
other
merchants
went
to
the
wÃlee
and
acquainted
him
with
the
case
and
that
this
was
but
half
a
lie
and
when
the
people
who
were
present
heard
this
they
were
astonished
at
this
lie
and
struck
with
the
utmost
wonder
and
they
cursed
and
reviled
me
while
i
stood
laughing
and
saying
how
can
my
master
kill
me
when
he
bought
me
with
this
fault

so
when
my
master
went
to
the
house
he
found
it
in
a
state
of
ruin
and
it
was
i
who
destroyed
the
greater
part
and
broke
in
it
things
worth
a
large
sum
of
money
and
his
wife
said
to
him
it
was
kÃfoor
who
broke
the
vessels
and
the
china-ware
upon
this
his
rage
increased
and
he
exclaimed
by
allah
in
my
life
i
have
never
seen
such
a
misbegotten
wretch
as
this
slave
yet
he
calleth
it
half
a
lie
what
then
would
have
been
the
result
had
it
been
a
whole
lie
in
that
case
he
had
destroyed
a
city
or
two
citiesâthen
in
the
excess
of
his
rage
he
went
to
the
wÃlee
who
inflicted
upon
me
a
severe
beating
so
that
i
became
insensible
and
swooned
away
after
which
my
master
contrived
means
of
obtaining
for
me
a
high
price
and
i
ceased
not
to
excite
disturbances
in
the
places
into
which
i
was
sold
and
was
transferred
from
emeer
to
emeer
and
from
grandee
to
grandee
by
sale
and
purchase
until
i
entered
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
now
my
spirit
is
broken
and
my
strength
hath
failed445

continuation
of
the
story
of
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love

when
the
other
slaves
had
heard
his
story
they
laughed
at
it
and
said
to
him
verily
thou
art
a
villain
the
son
of
a
villain
thou
hast
told
an
abominable
lie
the
first
and
second
then
said
to
the
third
slave
relate
to
us
thy
storyâo
sons
of
my
uncle
he
replied
all
that
hath
just
been
related
is
nonsense
but
my
story
is
long
and
this
is
not
a
time
to
tell
it
for
the
morning
o
sons
of
my
uncle
is
near
and
perhaps
it
may
overtake
us
with
this
chest
still
before
us
and
we
shall
be
disgraced
among
the
public
and
our
lives
will
be
lost
haste
then
to
work
and
when
we
have
finished
and
returned
home
i
will
relate
to
you
my
story
so
they
put
down
the
light
and
dug
a
trench
of
the
size
of
the
chest
between
four
tombs
kÃfoor
digging
and
áawÃb
removing
the
earth
in
baskets
until
they
had
dug
to
the
depth
of
half
a
fathom
when
they
put
the
chest
into
the
trench
and
replaced
the
earth
over
it
and
went
forth
from
the
enclosure
and
having
closed
the
gate
disappeared
from
before
the
eyes
of
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob

when
therefore
they
had
left
the
place
vacant
unto
ghÃnim
and
he
knew
that
he
was
alone
his
mind
became
busied
respecting
the
contents
of
the
chest
and
he
said
within
himself
what
can
this
chest
contain
he
waited
until
daybreak
gleamed
and
shone
forth
and
then
descended
from
the
palm-tree
and
removed
the
earth
with
his
hand
until
he
had
uncovered
the
chest
and
disengaged
it
when
he
took
a
stone
and
struck
with
it
the
lock
and
broke
it
and
lifting
up
the
cover
he
looked
in
and
beheld
a
sleeping
damsel
stupified
with
benj17
but
still
breathing
she
was
of
beautiful
and
lovely
person
and
decked
with
ornaments
of
gold
and
necklaces
of
jewels
worth
a
kingdom
and
of
a
value
that
no
money
would
equal
when
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
beheld
her
he
knew
that
she
had
been
the
object
of
a
plot
and
being
convinced
of
this
he
pulled
her
up
until
he
had
lifted
her
out
of
the
chest
and
laid
her
upon
her
back
and
as
soon
as
she
scented
the
breeze
and
the
air
entered
her
nostrils
and
her
mouth
and
throat
she
sneezed
and
then
was
choked
and
coughed
whereupon
there
fell
from
her
throat
a
round
piece
of
benj
of
such
potency
that
if
an
elephant
smelt
it
he
would
sleep
from
one
night
to
another
she
then
opened
her
eyes
and
looking
round
said
with
an
eloquent
voice
wo
to
thee
o
wind
thou
neither
satisfiest
the
thirsty
nor
cheerest
by
thy
presence
the
satisfied
with
drink
where
is
zahr-el-bustÃnâbut446
no
one
answered
her
then
looking
aside
she
exclaimed

noor-el-hudÃ

nejmet-eá-áubá
art
thou
awake18
nuzheh

speak

no
one
answered
her
and
she
looked
round
about
her
and
exclaimed
alas
for
me
that
i
am
transported
to
the
tombs
o
thou
who
knowest
the
secrets
of
the
breasts
and
recompensest
on
the
day
of
resurrection
who
hath
brought
me
from
among
the
curtains
and
the
veils
and
placed
me
amid
four
tombs

koot-el-kuloob
awaking
while
she
was
saying
all
this
ghÃnim
stood
still
but
he
now
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
there
are
neither
veils
nor
palaces
nor
tombs
for
thee
here
this
is
none
other
than
thy
slave
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
whom
the
king
who
is
omniscient
with
respect
to
hidden
things
hath
impelled
hither
that
he
may
deliver
thee
from
these
troubles
and
that
the
utmost
of
thy
desires
may
be
accomplished
unto
theeâand
he
was
silent
and
when
she
became
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
case
she
exclaimed
i
testify
that
there
is
no
deity
but
god
and
i
testify
that
moáammad
is
gods
apostle
then
looking
towards
ghÃnim
with
her
hands
placed
upon
her
breast
she
said
to
him
with
a
sweet
voice
o
auspicious
youth
who
brought
me
unto447
this
place
for
now
i
have
recovered
my
sensesâo
my
mistress
he
answered
three
eunuchs
came
bearing
this
chestâand
he
related
to
her
all
that
had
happened
and
how
the
evening
had
overtaken
him
so
that
he
became
the
means
of
her
preservation
and
that
otherwise
she
had
died
of
suffocation
and
he
inquired
of
her
respecting
her
historyâo
youth
she
replied
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
cast
me
into
the
hands
of
one
like
thee
rise
therefore
now
and
put
me
into
the
chest
and
go
forth
to
the
road
and
as
soon
as
thou
shalt
find
any
one
who
lets
out
asses
or
other
beasts
or
a
muleteer
hire
him
to
transport
this
chest
and
convey
me
to
thy
house
and
when
i
am
in
thy
abode
it
will
be
well
and
i
will
relate
to
thee
my
story
and
acquaint
thee
with
my
tale
and
good
fortune
will
accrue
to
thee
through
my
meansâso
ghÃnim
rejoiced
and
he
went
forth
into
the
desert
tract

the
day
had
begun
to
gleam
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
and
the
people
come
walking
forth
and
ghÃnim
hired
a
man
with
a
mule
and
brought
him
to
the
burial-place
he
then
lifted
the
chest
after
he
had
put
the
damsel
into
it
and
with
his
heart
smitten
by
love
for
her
proceeded
with
her
full
of
joy
for
she
was
a
damsel
worth
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
was
decked
with
ornaments
and
apparel
of
enormous
value
scarcely
had
he
found
himself
at
his
house
when
he
put
down
the
chest
and
opened
it
and
took
forth
from
it
the
damsel
who
looked
and
saw
that
the
place
was
a
handsome
dwelling
furnished
with
variegated
carpets
and
she
observed
the
gay
colours
and
various
embellishments
and
beheld
stuffs
packed
up
and
loads
of
goods
and
other
property
so
she
knew
that
he
was
a
great
merchant
and
a
man
of
wealth
she
then
uncovered
her
face
and
looked
at
him
and
observed
him
to
be
a
handsome
young
man
and
loved
him
and
she
said
to
him
bring
us
something
to
eat
he
answered
her
on
the
head
and
the
eye
be
thy
commandsâand
went
to
the
market
and
bought
a
roasted
lamb
and
a
dish
of
sweetmeat
and
procured
some
dried
fruits
and
candles
and
wine
and
the
requisite
apparatus
for
perfumes
then
returning
to
the
house
he
took
in
the
things
and
when
the
damsel
saw
him
she
laughed
and
kissed
him
and
embraced
him
and
began
to
caress
him
so
that
the
love
which
he
felt
increased
and
took
entire
possession
of
his
heart
they
then
ate
and
drank
until
the
approach
of
night
and
their
love
was
mutual
for
they
were
both
of
the
same
age
and
both
equal
in
comeliness
and
when
the
night
approached
the
distracted
slave
of
love
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
rose
and
lighted
the
candles
and
lamps
and
the
chamber
glistened
he
then
brought
forth
the
wine-service
and
prepared
the448
table
and
sat
down
with
her
he
filling
and
handing
to
her
and
she
filling
and
handing
to
him
while
they
both
toyed
and
laughed
and
recited
verses
their
gaiety
increased
and
they
were
engrossed
by
mutual
loveâextolled
be
the
perfection
of
the
uniter
of
heartsâ
thus
they
continued
until
it
was
near
morning
when
sleep
overcame
them
and
each
of
them
slept
apart
from
the
other
till
morning
came

ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
then
arose
and
went
forth
to
the
market
and
bought
what
was
requisite
of
vegetables
and
meat
and
wine
and
other
provisions
and
brought
them
to
the
house
and
he
again
sat
with
her
to
eat
and
they
ate
until
they
were
satisfied
after
which
he
brought
the
wine
and
they
drank
and
toyed
together
till
their
cheeks
reddened
and
their
eyes
became
more
intensely
black19
and
ghÃnim
said
o
my
mistress
have
compassion
on
the
captive
of
thy
love
and
him
whom
thine
eyes
have
slain
i
had
remained
sound
of
heart
but
for
theeâthen
he
wept
a
while
and
she
replied
o
my
master
and
light
of
mine
eye
by
allah
i
love
thee
and
confide
in
thee
but
i
know
that
thou
canst
not
be
united
to
meâand
what
hindereth
said
he
she
answered
i
will
this
night
relate
to
thee
my
story
that
thou
mayest
accept
my
excuse
but
they
continued
thus
a
whole
month
and
after
this
one
night
when
ghÃnim
was
complaining
to
her
of
his
passion
she
said
to
him
i
will
now
explain
to
thee
my
case
that
thou
mayest
know
my
dignity
and
that
my
secret
may
be
revealed
to
thee
and
my
excuse
become
manifest
to
thee
he
replied
well
and
she
took
hold
of
a
band
which
confined
a
part
of
her
dress
and
said
to
him
o
my
master
read
what
is
on
this
border
so
he
took
the
border
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
and
found
worked
upon
it
in
gold
i
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
o
descendant
of
the
prophets
uncle20
and
when
he
had
read
this
he
let
fall
his
hand
and
said
to
her
reveal
to
me
thy
history
she
answered
wellâand
thus
beganâ

know
that
i
am
a
favourite
slave
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
my
name
is
áoot-el-áuloob21
the
prince
of
the
faithful
after
he
had
reared
me
in
his
palace
and
i
had
grown
up
observed
my
qualities
and
the
beauty
and
loveliness
with
which
my
lord
had
endowed
me
and
loved
me
excessively
he
took
me
and
lodged
me
in
a
private
apartment
and
appointed
me
ten
female
slaves
to
serve
me
and
then
gave
me
those
ornaments
which
thou
seest
with
me
after
this
the
khaleefeh
went
forth
one
day
on
a
journey
to
one
of
the
surrounding
provinces
and
the
lady
zubeydeh
came
to
one
of
the
female
slaves
who
were
in
my
service
and
said
when
thy
mistress449
áoot-el-áuloob
sleepeth
put
this
piece
of
benj
into
her
nose
and
her
drink
and
thou
shalt
receive
from
me
a
sum
of
money
that
will
satisfy
thee
the
slave
replied
most
willinglyâand
she
received
the
benj
from
her
rejoicing
on
account
of
the
money
and
because
she
had
been
originally
zubeydehs
slave
and
she
insinuated
the
benj
into
me
whereupon
i
fell
upon
the
floor
with
my
head
bent
down
to
my
feet
and
seemed
to
be
in
another
world
and
when
she
could
devise
no
other
stratagem
she
put
me
into
that
chest
and
privily
summoned
the
black
slaves
and
after
having
given
presents
to
them
and
to
the
door-keepers
sent
me
with
the
black
slaves
on
the
night
when
thou
wast
reposing
at
the
top
of
the
palm-tree
and
they
did
with
me
as
thou
sawest
and
my
deliverance
was
effected
through
thy
means
then
thou
broughtest
me
unto
this
place
where
thou
hast
treated
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
this
is
my
story
and
i
know
not
what
hath
happened
to
the
khaleefeh
during
my
absence
know
therefore
my
dignity
and
divulge
not
my
case

when
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
heard
these
words
of
áoot-el-áuloob
and
discovered
that
she
was
the
favourite
of
the
khaleefeh
he
drew
back
in
his
awe
of
the
khaleefeh
and
sat
alone
at
one
side
of
the
chamber
blaming
himself
and
reflecting
upon
his
situation
perplexed
by
love
of
her
to
whom
he
could
not
be
united
and
he
wept
from
the
violence
of
his
desire
and
the
fierceness
of
his
passion
and
distraction
and
began
to
complain
of
fortune
and
its
injusticeâextolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
causeth
the
hearts
of
the
generous
to
be
troubled
with
love
and
endueth
not
the
mean
with
so
much
of
it
as
equalleth
the
weight
of
a
grainâand
upon
this
áoot-el-áuloob
rose
to
him
and
embraced
and
kissed
him
and
her
heart
being
entirely
captivated
by
his
love
she
revealed
what
she
had
hidden
of
the
extent
of
her
passion
and
encircled
his
neck
with
her
arms
and
kissed
him
again
but
he
withdrew
from
her
embrace
in
his
fear
of
the
khaleefeh
they
then
conversed
a
while
drowned
in
the
sea
of
mutual
love
and
so
remained
until
day
when
ghÃnim
arose
and
went
forth
to
the
market
as
usual
and
procured
what
was
requisite
and
returning
to
the
house
found
áoot-el-áuloob
weeping
but
as
soon
as
she
beheld
him
she
ceased
from
her
tears
and
smiled
and
said
to
him
thou
hast
made
me
desolate
by
thine
absence
o
beloved
of
my
heart
by
allah
this
hour
during
which
thou
hast
been
away
from
me
hath
appeared
as
a
year
for
i
cannot
endure
thy
separation
and
see
i
have
thus
shewn
thee
my
state
through
the
violence
of
my
passion
arise
therefore
now
and
mind
not
what
hath
happened
but450
take
me
as
thy
wifeâbut
he
replied
i
seek
refuge
with
allah
this
is
a
thing
that
cannot
be
how
should
the
dog
sit
in
the
place
of
the
lion
what
belongeth
to
my
lord
is
forbidden
me
to
approachâhe
then
tore
himself
from
her
and
sat
apart
and
she
increased
in
love
through
his
refusalâin
this
manner
they
passed
three
long
months
and
whenever
she
made
any
advances
to
him
he
withdrew
from
her
and
said
whatever
belongeth
to
the
master
is
forbidden
to
the
slaveâsuch
was
the
case
of
the
distracted
slave
of
love
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob

meanwhile
zubeydeh
during
the
absence
of
the
khaleefeh
having
acted
thus
with
áoot-el-áuloob
became
perplexed
saying
within
herself
what
shall
i
say
to
the
khaleefeh
when
he
cometh
and
inquireth
respecting
her
and
what
shall
be
my
answer
to
him
she
then
called
for
an
old
woman
who
resided
with
her
and
acquainted
her
with
her
secret
and
said
to
her
what
shall
i
do
now
that
áoot-el-áuloob
is
no
more
the
old
woman
answered
when
she
understood
the
affair
know
o
my
mistress
that
the
return
of
the
khaleefeh
is
near
but
i
will
send
to
a
carpenter
and
desire
him
to
make
a
wooden
image
of
a
corpse
and
they
shall
dig
for
it
a
grave
and
thou
shalt
light
candles
and
lamps
around
it
and
command
every
one
who
is
in
the
palace
to
wear
black22
and
order
thy
female
slaves
and
eunuchs
as
soon
as
they
know
of
the
khaleefehs
return
from
his
journey
to
raise
lamentations
in
the
vestibules
and
when
he
enters
and
asks
the
news
they
shall
answer
him
áoot-el-áuloob
is
dead
and
may
god
abundantly
compensate
thee
for
the
loss
of
herâand
from
the
esteem
with
which
she
was
regarded
by
our
mistress
she
hath
buried
her
in
her
own
palace
so
when
he
heareth
this
he
will
weep
and
the
event
will
distress
him
then
he
will
cause
the
readers
to
sit
up
by
night
at
her
tomb
to
perform
recitations
of
the
áur-Ãn
and
if
he
say
within
himself
surely
the
daughter
of
my
uncle
through
her
jealousy
hath
been
led
to
destroy
áoot-el-áuloobâor
the
distraction
of
love
overpower
him
and
he
give
orders
to
take
her
forth
from
the
tomb
fear
not
from
that
for
if
they
dig
down
to
the
image
in
the
form
of
a
human
being
and
take
it
forth
shrouded
in
costly
grave-clothes
and
the
khaleefeh
desire
to
remove
the
grave-clothes
from
it
to
behold
her
do
thou
prevent
him
and
the
fear
of
the
world
to
come
will
withhold
him
and
do
thou
say
to
him
to
behold
her
corpse
uncovered
is
unlawful
then
he
will
believe
her
death
and
will
return
her
image
to
its
place
and
thank
thee
for
thy
conduct
and
thou
shalt
escape
if
it
please
god
from
this
difficultyâwhen
the
lady
zubeydeh
therefore
heard451
what
she
said
she
approved
it
and
bestowed
upon
her
a
dress
of
honour
and
commanded
her
to
do
this
having
given
her
a
sum
of
money
so
the
old
woman
set
about
the
business
immediately
and
ordered
the
carpenter
to
make
for
her
an
image
as
above
described
and
when
it
was
finished
she
brought
it
to
the
lady
zubeydeh
and
she
shrouded
it
and
lighted
the
candles
and
lamps
and
spread
the
carpets
around
the
tomb
and
clad
herself
in
black
ordering
the
female
slaves
to
do
the
same
and
the
news
was
spread
through
the
palace
that
áoot-el-áuloob
had
died

pretended
tomb
of
koot-el-kuloob
some
time
after
this
the
khaleefeh
returned
from
his
journey
and
went
up
to
his
palace
but
his
mind
was
occupied
only
with
áoot-el-áuloob
and
seeing
the
pages
and
eunuchs
and
female
slaves
all
clad
in
black
his
heart
was
agitated
and
when
he
entered
the
palace
of
the
lady
zubeydeh
and
beheld
her
also
clad
in
black
he452
inquired
the
reason
of
it
and
they
informed
him
of
the
death
of
áoot-el-áuloob
upon
hearing
this
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
he
recovered
he
asked
where
was
her
tomb
and
the
lady
zubeydeh
answered
know
o
prince
of
the
faithful
that
on
account
of
the
esteem
in
which
she
was
held
by
me
i
buried
her
in
my
palace
so
the
khaleefeh
entering
the
palace
in
his
travelling-dress
proceeded
to
visit
the
tomb
of
áoot-el-áuloob
and
found
the
carpets
spread
and
the
candles
and
lamps
lighted
and
when
he
beheld
this
he
thanked
her
for
what
she
had
done
but
afterwards
he
became
perplexed
and
wavered
a
while
between
belief
and
disbelief
until
suspicion
overcame
him
and
he
gave
orders
to
open
the
tomb
and
to
take
her
out
when
however
he
saw
the
grave-clothes
and
was
about
to
remove
them
that
he
might
behold
her
he
feared
god
whose
name
be
exalted
and
the
old
woman
said
restore
her
to
her
place
then
immediately
the
khaleefeh
commanded
to
bring
the
professors
of
religion
and
law
and
the
readers
and
they
performed
recitations
of
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
at
her
tomb
while
he
sat
by
the
side
of
it
weeping
until
he
became
insensible

he
continued
to
frequent
the
tomb
for
the
space
of
a
month
after
which
it
happened
that
he
entered
the
áareem
after
the
emeers
and
wezeers
had
dispersed
from
before
him
to
their
houses
and
he
slept
a
while
and
a
female
slave
sat
at
his
head
and
another
at
his
feet
and
after
sleep
had
overcome
him
he
awoke
and
opened
his
eyes
and
heard
the
damsel
who
was
at
his
head
say
to
her
who
was
at
his
feet
wo

said
the

hath
happened
so
he
sitteth
up
by
night
at
a
tomb
in
which
there
is
nothing
but
a
carved
image
the
work
of
the
carpenterâand
what
then
asked

other
damsel

befallen
áoot-el-áuloob
her
companion
answered
know
that
our
mistress
zubeydeh
sent
some
benj
by
a
female
slave
and
she
stupified
her
with
it
and
when
the
benj
had
taken
effect
upon
her
she
put
her
in
a
chest
and
sent
her
away
with
áawÃb
and
kÃfoor
commanding
them
to
throw
her
into
the
tomb
upon
this
kheyzurÃn
said
wo
to
thee
o
áaáeeb
is
not
the
lady
áoot-el-áuloob
deadâheaven
preserve
her
youth
from
death
answered
áaáeeb
i
heard
the
lady
zubeydeh
say
that
áoot-el-áuloob
was
with
a
young
merchant
named
ghÃnim
of
damascus
and
that
she
had
been
with
him
including
this
day
four
months
and
our
lord
here
weepeth
and
passeth
sleepless
nights
at
a
tomb
in
which
there
is
no
corpseâthus
they
conversed
together
while
the
khaleefeh
heard
their
words
and453
when
they
had
finished
their
conversation
and
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
event
that
this
tomb
was
a
false
one
and
that
áoot-el-áuloob
had
been
with
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
for
the
space
of
four
months
he
was
violently
incensed
and
arose
and
summoned
the
emeers
of
his
court
whereupon
the
wezeer
jaáºfar
el-barmekee
presented
himself
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
the
khaleefeh
said
to
him
in
anger
descend
o
jaáºfar
with
a
body
of
men
and
inquire
for
the
house
of
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
assault
it
suddenly
and
bring
him
hither
with
my
female
slave
áoot-el-áuloob
and
i
will
assuredly
torture
him

jaáºfar
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
went
forth
with
his
attendants
the
wÃlee
also
accompanying
him
and
they
proceeded
until
they
arrived
at
ghÃnims
house
ghÃnim
had
just
before
gone
out
and
brought
a
pot
of
meat
and
was
about
to
stretch
forth
his
hand
to
eat
of
it
with
áoot-el-áuloob
when
she
looked
out
and
found
that
the
house
was
beset
on
all
sides
and
the
wezeer
and
the
wÃlee
and
the
officers
of
violence
and
the
memlooks
with
drawn
swords
were
surrounding
it
as
the
black
surrounds
the
pupil
of
the
eye
and
upon
this
she
knew
that
tidings
of
her
situation
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
khaleefeh
her
lord
and
she
made
sure
of
destruction
her
countenance
became
pale
and
her
beauty
changed
and
looking
towards
ghÃnim
she
said
to
him
o
my
beloved
save
thyselfâhow
shall
i
do
said
he
and
whither
shall
i
flee
when
my
wealth
and
means
of
subsistence
are
in
this
house
but
she
answered
delay
not
lest
thou
perish
and
thy
wealth
also
be
lostâo
my
mistress
and
light
of
mine
eye
rejoined
he
how
can
i
contrive
to
go
forth
when
they
are
surrounding
the
houseâfear
not
she
answeredâand
she
pulled
off
his
clothes
and
clad
him
in
worn-out
ragged
garments
and
taking
the
pot
that
had
contained
the
meat
placed
it
upon
his
head
and
put
in
it
a
little
bread
and
a
saucer
of
meat
and
said
to
him
go
forth
by
the
help
of
this
stratagem
and
thou
hast
nothing
to
fear
with
respect
to
me
for
i
know
what
i
am
able
to
do
with
the
khaleefeh
when
ghÃnim
therefore
heard
the
words
of
áoot-el-áuloob
and
the
advice
which
she
gave
him
he
went
forth
through
the
midst
of
them
bearing
the
pot
and
providence
protected
him
so
that
he
escaped
from
the
snares
and
injuries
which
menaced
him
by
the
blessing
of
his
good
conscience

and
when
the
wezeer
jaáºfar
arrived
at
the
house
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
entered
and
looked
at
áoot-el-áuloob
who
had
adorned
herself
and
filled
a
chest
with
gold
and
ornaments
and
jewels454
and
rarities
such
as
were
light
to
carry
and
of
great
value
and
when
jaáºfar
came
in
to
her
she
rose
upon
her
feet
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
saying
to
him
o
my
master
the
pen
hath
written
what
god
hath
decreed24
but
jaáºfar
when
he
beheld
her
situation
replied
by
allah
o
my
mistress
he
gave
me
no
order
but
to
arrest
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
she
said
know
that
he
hath
packed
up
some
bales
of
merchandise
and
gone
with
them
to
damascus
and
i
know
nothing
more
than
this
and
i
request
thee
to
take
care
of
this
chest
for
me
and
to
convey
it
to
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
so
jaáºfar
answered
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
took
the
chest
and
gave
orders
that
it
should
be
conveyed
together
with
áoot-el-áuloob
to
the
palace
of
the
khaleefeh
treating
her
with
honour
and
respect
this
took
place
after
they
had
plundered
the
house
of
ghÃnim
and
they
went
to
the
khaleefeh
and
jaáºfar
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
whereupon
the
khaleefeh
appointed
to
áoot-el-áuloob
a
dark
chamber
and
there
lodged
her
commissioning
an
old
woman
to
serve
her
for
he
imagined
that
ghÃnim
had
acted
dishonestly
towards
her

he
then
wrote
a
letter
to
the
emeer
moáammad
the
son
of
suleymÃn
ez-zeynee
who
was
viceroy
of
damascus
containing
as
followsâas
soon
as
this
letter
cometh
to
thy
hands
thou
shalt
arrest
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
send
him
unto
meâso
when
the
mandate
was
brought
to
him
he
kissed
it
and
put
it
upon
his
head
and
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
through
the
market-street
whosoever
desireth
to
plunder
let
him
repair
to
the
house
of
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
they
came
to
the
house
and
found
that
the
mother
of
ghÃnim
and
his
sister
had
made
for
them
a
tomb
and
sat
by
it
weeping
and
they
laid
hold
upon
them
and
plundered
the
house
and
the
mother
and
sister
knew
not
the
cause
and
when
they
brought
them
before
the
suláÃn25
he
inquired
of
them
respecting
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
they
answered
him
for
the
space
of
a
year
we
have
obtained
no
tidings
of
himâand
they
restored
them
to
their
place26

ghÃnim
sick
in
a
mosque
in
the
mean
time
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love
when
his
wealth
had
been
seized
was
perplexed
and
began
to
weep
for
himself
so
as
to
break
his
heart
he
walked
on
and
ceased
not
on
his
way
to
the
close
of
day
suffering
from
excessive
hunger
and
fatigue
until
he
arrived
at
a
village
where
he
entered
a
mosque
and
seated
himself
upon
a
round
mat27
and
he
leaned
his
back
against
one
of
the
walls
of
the
building
and
then
threw
himself
down
under
the
influence
of
extreme
hunger
and
weariness
there455
he
remained
until
the
morning
his
heart
palpitating
from
want
of
food
vermin
attacked
his
body
his
breath
became
fetid
and
he
was
altogether
changed
and
the
people
of
that
village
coming
to
perform
the
morning-prayers
found
him
lying
there
sick
through
want
of
food
yet
exhibiting
evident
traces
of
former
affluence
and
when
they
approached
him
they
found
him
cold
and
hungry
they
clad
him
therefore
with
an
old
garment
having
ragged
sleeves
and
said
to
him
whence
art
thou
o
stranger
and
what
is
the
cause
of
thine
infirmity
and
ghÃnim
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
and
wept
but
he
returned
them
no
answer
then
one
of
them
knowing
the
violence
of
his
hunger
went
and
brought
him
a
saucer
of
honey
and
two
cakes
of
bread
and
he
ate
while
they
sat
around
him
until
the
sun
rose
when
they
departed
to
their
several
occupationsâin
this
state
he
remained
among
them
for
a
month
and
his
infirmity
and
disease
increased
so
the
people
commiserating
him
consulted
together456
respecting
his
case
and
agreed
to
transport
him
to
the
hospital
at
baghdÃd

now
while
they
were
thus
conversing
lo
two
women
beggars
came
in
to
him
and
they
were
his
mother
and
sister
and
when
he
beheld
them
he
gave
them
the
bread
that
was
at
his
head
and
they
slept
by
him
the
next
night
but
he
knew
them
not
and
on
the
following
day
the
people
of
the
village
came
to
him
bringing
a
camel
and
said
to
its
owner
convey
this
sick
person
on
the
camel
and
when
thou
hast
arrived
at
baghdÃd
put
him
down
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
perhaps
he
may
recover
his
health
and
thou
wilt
receive
a
recompense
he
answered
them
i
hear
and
obey
so
they
brought
forth
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
from
the
mosque
and
placed
him
with
the
round
mat
upon
which
he
was
sleeping
on
the
camel
and
his
mother
and
sister
came
to
look
at
him
among
the
other
people
but
they
knew
him
not
then
observing
him
attentively
they
said
verily
he
resembleth
our
ghÃnim
can
he
be
this
sick
person
or
notâbut
as
to
ghÃnim
he
awoke
not
until
he
was
mounted
on
the
camel
and
he
began
to
weep
and
moan
and
the
people
of
the
village
saw
his
mother
and
sister
weeping
for
him
though
they
did
not
know
him
then
his
mother
and
sister
journeyed
onwards
to
baghdÃd
while
the
camel-driver
also
proceeded
without
stopping
until
he
had
deposited
ghÃnim
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
when
he
took
his
camel
and
returned

ghÃnim
remained
lying
there
until
the
morning
and
when
the
people
began
to
pass
along
the
street
they
beheld
him
he
had
become
so
emaciated
that
his
form
resembled
that
of
a
toothpick
and
the
people
ceased
not
to
gaze
at
him
until
the
sheykh
of
the
market
came
and
repelled
them
from
him
and
said
i
will
gain
paradise
by
means
of
this
poor
person
for
if
they
take
him
into
the
hospital
they
will
kill
him
in
one
day
he
then
ordered
his
young
men
to
carry
him
and
they
conveyed
him
to
his
house
where
he
spread
for
him
a
new
bed
and
put
for
him
a
new
cushion
and
said
to
his
wife
serve
him
faithfully
she
replied
on
the
headâand
she
tucked
up
her
sleeves
and
having
heated
for
him
some
water
washed
his
hands
and
feet
and
body
and
clothed
him
in
a
vest
of
one
of
her
female
slaves
she
then
gave
him
to
drink
a
cup
of
wine
and
sprinkled
rose-water
upon
him
so
he
recovered
his
senses
and
he
remembered
his
beloved
áoot-el-áuloob
and
his
anguish
increasedâthus
did
it
happen
to
ghÃnim

now
as
to
áoot-el-áuloobâwhen
the
khaleefeh
incensed
against457
her
had
lodged
her
in
the
dark
chamber
she
remained
there
in
the
same
state
for
eighty
days
and
it
happened
that
the
khaleefeh
passed
one
day
by
that
place
and
heard
her
reciting
verses
and
when
she
had
finished
her
recitation
of
them
she
exclaimed
o
my
beloved
o
ghÃnim
how
kind
art
thou
and
how
chaste
is
thy
disposition
thou
hast
acted
with
kindness
unto
him
who
hath
injured
thee
and
hast
guarded
the
honour
of
him
who
hath
violated
thine
and
hast
protected
his
áareem
and
he
hath
enslaved
both
thee
and
thy
family
but
thou
wilt
assuredly
stand
with
the
prince
of
the
faithful
before
a
just
judge
and
thou
wilt
obtain
justice
against
him
on
the
day
when
the
judge
shall
be
god
and
the
witnesses
the
angelsâand
when
the
khaleefeh
heard
her
words
and
understood
her
complaint
he
knew
that
she
was
injured
and
he
entered
his
palace
and
sent
the
eunuch
to
her
and
when
she
came
before
him
she
hung
down
her
head
with
weeping
eye
and
sorrowful
heart
and
he
said
to
her
o
áoot-el-áuloob
i
see
that
thou
complainest
of
my
oppression
and
accusest
me
of
tyranny
and
thinkest
that
i
have
injured
him
who
hath
acted
kindly
unto
me
who
then
is
he
who
hath
guarded
my
honour
and
i
have
violated
his
and
who
hath
protected
my
áareem
and
i
have
enslaved
his28âshe
answered
him
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
for
he
hath
not
attempted
any
dishonest
action
towards
me
by
thy
beneficence
o
prince
of
the
faithfulâupon
this
the
khaleefeh
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
godâand
then
added
o
áoot-el-áuloob
desire
of
me
what
thou
wilt
and
i
will
grant
thy
wish
so
she
replied
i
desire
of
thee
my
beloved
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
and
when
he
heard
her
words
he
said
i
will
cause
him
to
be
brought
hither
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
in
honourâo
prince
of
the
faithful
she
rejoined
when
thou
shalt
have
caused
him
to
be
brought
wilt
thou
present
me
to
him
he
answered
when
i
have
had
him
brought
i
will
present
thee
to
him
the
present
of
a
generous
man
who
will
not
revoke
his
gift
so
she
said
o
prince
of
the
faithful
permit
me
to
search
about
for
him
perhaps
god
may
unite
me
with
him
and
he
replied
do
as
thou
wilt

upon
this
she
rejoiced
and
went
forth
taking
with
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
visited
the
sheykhs
and
gave
alms
for
the
sake
of
ghÃnim29
and
on
the
following
day
she
went
to
the
market
of
the
merchants
and
gave
to
the
chief
of
the
market
some
money
saying
to
him
bestow
it
in
alms
upon
the
strangers
then
again
in
the
following
week
she
went
forth
taking
with
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
entering
the
market
of
the
goldsmiths
and
jewellers
sum458moned
the
chief
of
the
market
and
he
came
and
she
gave
him
the
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
said
to
him
bestow
it
in
alms
upon
the
strangers
whereupon
the
chief
who
was
the
sheykh
of
the
market
before
mentioned
looked
at
her
and
said
to
her
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
my
house
to
look
at
a
young
stranger
there
and
see
how
elegant
he
is
and
how
perfectly
charming
for
it
is
probable
that
he
is
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
loveâbut
the
chief
had
no
knowledge
of
him
and
imagined
that
he
was
a
poor
person
involved
in
debt
whose
wealth
had
been
taken
from
him
or
a
lover
parted
from
his
beloved
and
when
she
heard
his
words
her
heart
beat
and
her
affections
were
engrossed
by
him
and
she
answered
send
with
me
some
one
to
conduct
me
to
thy
house
so
he
sent
with
her
a
young
boy
who
conducted
her
to
the
house
where
the
stranger
was
lodged
and
she
thanked
him
for
doing
so
and
when
she
entered
the
house
and
saluted
the
chiefs
wife
the
latter
arose
and
kissed
the
ground
before
her
for
she
knew
her
then
áoot-el-áuloob
said
to
her
where
is
the
sick
person
who
is
with
you
and
she
wept
and
answered
here
he
is
o
my
mistress
but
he
is
of
a
respectable
family
and
exhibiteth
traces
of
former
affluence
and
áoot-el-áuloob
looked
towards
the
bed
upon
which
he
was
lying
and
regarding
him
narrowly
beheld
him
as
though
he
were
ghÃnim
himself
but
his
condition
was
changed
and
he
had
become
so
emaciated
that
he
resembled
a
toothpick
and
the
truth
of
his
case
was
disguised
from
her
so
that
she
did
not
discover
him
to
be
the
person
whom
she
sought
but
she
was
moved
with
compassion
for
him
and
she
wept
and
exclaimed
verily
strangers
are
objects
of
pity
though
they
be
emeers
in
their
own
countries
she
then
ordered
for
him
supplies
of
wine
and
medicines
and
sat
at
his
head
a
while
and
mounted
and
returned
to
her
palace
and
she
continued
to
go
forth
to
every
market
for
the
purpose
of
searching
for
ghÃnim

ghÃnims
mother
and
sister
as
beggars
soon
after
the
chief
of
the
market
brought
the
mother
of
ghÃnim
and
his
sister
fitneh
and
went
with
them
to
áoot-el-áuloob
and
said
to
her
o
most
charitable
lady
there
have
entered
our
city
this
day
a
woman
and
a
girl
of
respectable
origin
bearing
evident
traces
of
former
affluence
but
they
are
clad
in
garments
of
hair-cloth
and
each
of
them
hath
a
wallet
hung
to
her
neck
and
their
eyes
are
weeping
and
their
hearts
sorrowful
so
i
have
brought
them
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
give
them
refuge
and
preserve
them
from
the
disgrace
of
beggary
for
they
are
not
persons
suited
to
ask
alms
of
the
sordid
and
if
it
please
god
we
shall
enter
paradise
by
their
meansâby459
allah
o
my
master
she
replied
thou
hast
made
me
long
to
behold
them
where
are
they
order
them
to
come
inâso
upon
this
fitneh
and
her
mother
came
in
to
áoot-el-áuloob
who
when
she
saw
them
and
observed
that
they
were
both
distinguished
by
beauty
wept
for
them
and
said
by
allah
they
are
persons
of
an
affluent
family
and
traces
of
wealth
are
conspicuous
in
their
appearanceâo
my
mistress
replied
the
chief
of
the
market
we
love
the
poor
and
indigent
for
the
sake
of
future
recompense30
and
probably
the
extortioners
have
oppressed
these
two
persons
and
plundered
them
of
their
wealth
and
ruined
their
houses
then
these
two
females
wept
violently
and
remembering
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love
their
wailing
increased
and
áoot-el-áuloob
wept
with
them
and
the
mother
of
ghÃnim
exclaimed
we
pray
god
to
unite
us
with
him
whom
we
seek
and
he
is
my
son
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
when
áoot-el-áuloob
therefore
heard
these
words
she
knew
that
this
woman
was
the
mother
of
her
beloved
and
that
the
other
was
his
sister
and
she
wept
until
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
she
recovered
she
approached
them
and
said
to
them
ye
have
nothing
to
fear
for
this
day
is
the
first
of
your
prosperity
and
the
last
of
your
adversity460
therefore
grieve
not
she
then
ordered
the
chief
of
the
market
to
take
them
to
his
house
and
to
let
his
wife
conduct
them
into
the
bath
and
attire
them
in
handsome
clothing
and
take
care
of
them
and
treat
them
with
the
utmost
honour
and
she
gave
him
a
sum
of
money

then
on
the
following
day
áoot-el-áuloob
mounted
and
went
again
to
the
house
of
the
chief
of
the
market
and
went
in
to
visit
his
wife
who
rose
to
her
and
kissed
the
ground
before
her
and
thanked
her
for
her
charity
and
she
saw
that
his
wife
had
conducted
the
mother
of
ghÃnim
and
his
sister
to
the
bath
and
taken
off
their
former
clothes
and
that
the
traces
of
their
original
affluence
had
become
more
conspicuous
in
consequence
and
she
sat
a
while
conversing
with
them
after
which
she
asked
the
wife
of
the
chief
of
the
market
respecting
the
sick
person
who
was
with
her
she
answered
he
is
in
the
same
state
and
áoot-el-áuloob
said
arise
and
let
us
look
at
him
and
visit
him
so
they
both
arose
with
ghÃnims
mother
and
sister
and
went
in
to
him
and
seated
themselves
by
him
and
when
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love
heard
one
of
them
mention
áoot-el-áuloob
emaciated
as
he
was
in
body
and
limbs
his
soul
returned
to
him
and
he
raised
his
head
from
the
pillow
and
called
out
o
áoot-el-áuloob
she
looked
at
him
therefore
and
knew
him
and
cried
saying
yes
o
my
beloved
he
then
said
to
her
draw
near
to
me
and
she
asked
him
art
thou
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love
he
answered
her
yes
i
am
he
and
upon
this
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
his
sister
and
his
mother
heard
their
words
they
cried
out
oh
our
joyâand
in
like
manner
fainted
and
when
they
recovered
áoot-el-áuloob
said
to
ghÃnim
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
united
us
with
thee
and
with
thy
mother
and
sister
then
approaching
him
she
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
to
her
with
the
khaleefeh
adding
i
said
to
him
i
have
declared
to
thee
the
truth
o
prince
of
the
faithfulâand
he
believed
my
words
and
approved
thee
and
he
is
now
desiring
to
see
thee
and
she
said
to
him
the
khaleefeh
hath
given
me
to
theeâwhereupon
he
was
filled
with
the
utmost
joy
and
áoot-el-áuloob
said
to
them
all
quit
not
this
place
until
i
come
again

she
then
arose
immediately
and
departed
to
her
palace
and
removed
thence
the
chest
that
she
had
brought
from
ghÃnims
house
and
took
forth
from
it
some
pieces
of
gold
which
she
gave
to
the
chief
of
the
market
saying
to
him
take
these
pieces
of
gold
and
buy461
for
each
of
them
four
complete
suits
of
dress
of
the
best
kinds
of
stuff
and
twenty
handkerchiefs
and
whatever
else
they
require
and
after
this
she
conducted
them
to
the
bath
and
gave
orders
to
wash
them
and
prepared
for
them
boiled
meats
and
infusion
of
galangal
and
apple-water
after
they
had
come
forth
from
the
bath
and
dressed
themselves
for
three
days
she
remained
with
them
feeding
them
with
fowls
and
with
boiled
meats
and
giving
them
sherbet
of
refined
sugar
to
drink
and
after
the
three
days
their
spirits
returned
to
them
then
she
conducted
them
again
to
the
bath
and
they
came
forth
and
she
changed
their
clothes
and
leaving
them
in
the
house
of
the
chief
of
the
market
went
to
the
khaleefeh
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
related
to
him
the
story
telling
him
that
her
master
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
the
distracted
slave
of
love
had
come
and
that
his
mother
and
sister
also
had
arrived
when
the
khaleefeh
therefore
heard
these
words
of
áoot-el-áuloob
he
said
to
the
eunuchs
bring
hither
to
me
ghÃnim
and
jaáºfar
went
down
with
them
to
bring
him
but
áoot-el-áuloob
had
gone
before
him
and
she
went
in
unto
ghÃnim
and
said
to
him
the
khaleefeh
hath
sent
to
thee
to
bring
thee
before
him
have
a
care
then
to
display
eloquence
of
tongue
and
firmness
of
heart
and
sweetness
of
speech
and
she
attired
him
in
a
magnificent
dress
and
gave
him
pieces
of
gold
in
abundance
saying
to
him
bestow
plentifully
upon
the
domestics
of
the
khaleefeh
as
thou
goest
in
to
him
and
lo
jaáºfar
approached
him
mounted
upon
his
mule
and
ghÃnim
advanced
to
meet
him
and
greeted
him
with
a
prayer
for
long
life
kissing
the
ground
before
him

the
planet
of
his
prosperity
had
appeared
and
the
star
of
his
glory
had
risen
aloft
and
jaáºfar
took
him
and
they
proceeded
until
they
entered
into
the
presence
of
the
prince
of
the
faithful
and
when
ghÃnim
came
before
him
he
looked
towards
the
wezeers
and
emeers
and
chamberlains
and
lieutenants
and
the
other
officers
of
the
court
and
the
warriours
and
being
eloquent
of
tongue
firm
of
heart
delicate
in
the
style
of
his
language
and
pleasing
in
the
allusions
it
conveyed
he
hung
down
his
head
towards
the
ground
and
then
looked
towards
the
khaleefeh
and
addressed
him
in
a
series
of
complimentary
verses
and
when
he
had
finished
his
recitation
the
khaleefeh
was
delighted
with
the
graces
of
his
person
and
pleased
with
the
eloquence
of
his
tongue
and
the
sweetness
of
his
speech
and
he
said
to
him
approach
me
he
therefore
approached
him
and
the
khaleefeh
said
to
him
explain
to
me
thy
tale
and
acquaint
me
with
the
truth
of
thy
history
so
ghÃnim
sat
and
related
to
the
khaleefeh
all
that
had462
happened
to
him
from
beginning
to
end
and
when
the
khaleefeh
knew
that
he
spoke
truth
he
bestowed
upon
him
a
dress
of
honour
and
admitted
him
into
his
favour
and
said
to
him
acquit
me
of
responsibility31
and
he
did
so
and
said
to
him
o
prince
of
the
faithful
the
slave
and
all
that
his
hands
possess
belong
to
his
masterâand
the
khaleefeh
rejoiced
he
then
gave
orders
to
appropriate
a
palace
to
him
exclusively
and
appointed
him
abundant
pensions
and
allowances
and
removed
to
him
his
mother
and
his
sister
and
the
khaleefeh
hearing
that
his
sister
fitneh
was
in
beauty
as
her
name
imported
a
temptation
demanded
her
of
him
in
marriage
ghÃnim
therefore
replied
she
is
thy
handmaid32
and
i
am
thy
memlook
and
the
khaleefeh
thanked
him
and
gave
him
a
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold33
and
summoned
the
áÃáee
and
witnesses
and
they
performed
the
marriage-contract
then
he
and
ghÃnim
visited
their
wives
on
the
same
day
the
khaleefeh
going
to
fitneh
and
ghÃnim
the
son
of
eiyoob
to
áoot-el-áuloob
and
on
the
following
morning
the
khaleefeh
ordered
that
all
that
had
happened
to
ghÃnim
from
first
to
last
should
be
committed
to
writing
and
inserted
in
the
records
that
his
posterity
might
consider
it
and
wonder
at
the
disposals
of
destiny
and
commit
their
affairs
unto
the
creator
of
the
night
and
the
day34

i

i
have

other
persons
in

that
sometimes
slaves
brought
to

note

this
story
is
not
in
the
old
version
but
i
think
the
reader
will
consider
it
worthy
of
insertion
in
the
present
series
as
an
amusing
illustration
of
the
customs
which
are
often
observed
by
the
arabs
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
the
master
of
a
family
i
can
bear
testimony
to
the
general
correctness
of
the
picture
which
it
presents
or
rather
state
that
the
greatest
of
the
extravagances
which
it
describes
are
not
unfrequently
practised
in
the
present
day464

note

as
the
arab
women
are
much
more
reluctant
to
uncover
the
upper
and
back
part
of
the
head
than
they
are
to
shew
the
face
before
strange
men
such
a
scene
as
that
which
is
here
described
is
very
seldom
witnessed
but
i
have
seen
not
so
unfrequently
a
woman
with
her
face
uncovered
and
besmeared
with
mud
on
her
receiving
the
news
of
the
sudden
death
of
a
near
relation

note

this
to
some
readers
may
require
explanation
to
free
a
slave
who
has
no
means
of
providing
for
himself
and
not
to
grant
him
any
means
to
do
so
is
almost
the
heaviest
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
upon
him
and
to
do
this
unless

the

some
remarks
which
i
have
made
on
this
subject
with
reference
to
the
egyptians
in
a
former
work
are
equally
applicable
to
the
arabs
in
general
benevolence
and
charity
to
the
poor
are
virtues
which
the
egyptians
possess
in
an
eminent
degree
and
which
are
instilled
into
their
hearts
by
religion
but
from
their
own
profession
it
appears
that
they
are
as
much
excited
to
the
giving
of
alms
by
the
expectation
of
enjoying
corresponding
rewards
in
heaven
as
by
pity
for
the
distresses
of
their
fellow-creatures
or
a
disinterested
wish
to
do
the
will
of
god
it
may
be
attributed
in
some
measure
to
the
charitable
disposition
of
the
inhabitants
that
beggars
are
so
numerous
in
cairo
the
many
handsome
sebeels
or
public
fountains
buildings
erected
and
endowed
for
the
gratuitous
supply
of
water
to
passengers
which
are
seen
in
this
city
and
the
more
humble
structures
of
the
same
kind
in
the
villages
and
fields
are
monuments
of
the
same
virtue355
so
also
the
numerous
khÃns
for
the
reception
of
travellers
in
countries
occupied
by
the
arabs
bear
testimony
to
the
charity
of
this
people

is
often
said
by
an
arab

the
passion
of
love
among
the
arabs
a
few
remarks
on
this
subject
may
be
inserted
to
justify
the
picture
of
love
presented
in
the
foregoing
tale
that
sensual
passion
is
most
prevalent
among
the
arabs
cannot
be
doubted
but
i
think
it
unjust
to
suppose
them
generally
incapable
of
a
purer
feeling
worthy
if
constancy
be
a
sufficient
test
of
being
termed
true
love
that
they
are
not
so
appears
evident
to
almost
every
person
who
mixes
with
them
in
familiar
society
for
such
a
person
must
have
opportunities
of
being
acquainted
with
many
arabs
sincerely
attached
to
wives
whose
personal
charms
have
long
vanished
and
who
have
neither
wealth
nor
influence
of
their
own
nor
wealthy
nor
influential
relations
to
induce
their
husbands
to
refrain
from
divorcing
them
it
very
often
happens
too
that
an
arab
is
sincerely
attached
to
a
wife
possessed
even
in
the
best
portion
of
her
age
of
few
charms
and
that
the
lasting
favourite
among
two
or
more
wives
is
not
the
most
handsome
this
opinion
i
am
sorry
to
observe
is
at
variance
as
far
as
the
arabs
of
the
towns
are
concerned
with
that
entertained
by
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
experienced
of
modern
travellers
who
long
resided
among
this
peopleâthe
justly-celebrated
burckhardt356
but
466it
is
confirmed
by
numerous
facts
related
by
respectable
arab
authors
and
therefore
not
regarded
by
them
as
of
an
incredible
nature
as
well
as
by
cases
which
have
fallen
under
my
own
observation
the
tale
of
leylÃ

and
mejnoon
the
juliet
and
romeo
of
arabia
is
too
well
known
to
be
here
repeated
but
among
many
other
anecdotes
of
strong
and
constant
love
the
following
may
be
insertedâ

the
khaleefeh
yezeed
the
son
of
abd-el-melik
it
is
said
had
two
female
slaves
one
of
whom
was
named
áabbÃbeh
and
the
other
selÃmeh
to
the
former
of
whom
he
was
most
ardently
attached
he
had
purchased
her
for
a
hundred
thousand
dirhems
and
the
other
for
ten
thousand
in
the
company
of
these
two
females
he
sometimes
shut
himself
up
for
three
months
together
utterly
neglecting
the
affairs
of
his
people
at
length
being
reproved
for
this
conduct
by
his
brother
meslemeh
he
promised
to
return
to
his
duty
but
the
two
slaves
diverted
him
from
his
purpose
and
on
the
following
morning
excited
by
their
songs
and
caresses
and
by
wine
he
became
frantic
with
pleasure
and
danced
and
sang
like
a
madman
till
a
fatal
accident
put
a
stop
to
his
joy
áabbÃbeh
eating
a
pomegranate
was
choked
by
one
of
the
grains
and
immediately
died
the
grief
of
yezeed
was
so
poignant
that
he
would
not
quit
the
corpse
but
continued
to
kiss
and
fondle
it
until
it
became
putrid
being
then
admonished
by
his
attendants
that
proper
respect
required
its
burial
he
consented
to
commit
it
to
the
earth
after
five
days
however
his
desire
again
to
behold
the
object
of
his
love
induced
him
to
open
the
grave
and
though
the
corpse
had
become
hideous
he
declared
that
it
was
lovely
as
ever
in
his
eyes
at
the
earnest
request
of
meslemeh
he
ordered
the
grave
to
be
closed
again
but
he
was
unable
to
exist
when
deprived
of
the
sight
of
the
remains
of
her
who
was
at
the
same
time
his
slave
and
his
mistress
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
speechless
and
after
lingering
seventeen
nights
expired
and
was
buried
by
the
side
of
áabbÃbeh
may
god
says
the
narrator
have
mercy
on
them
both357

in
the
same
work
from
which
the
above
is
taken
it
is
related
that
hÃroon
er-rasheed
visiting
suleymÃn
the
son
of
aboo-jaáºfar
one
of
his
chief
officers
saw
467with
him
a
female
slave
named
áŒaeefeh
of
excessive
beauty
and
being
smitten
by
her
charms
demanded
her
as
a
present
his
request
was
granted
but
suleymÃn
from
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
mistress
fell
sick
and
during
his
illness
was
heard
to
exclaimâ

i
appeal
unto
god
against
the
affliction
which
he
hath
sent
upon
me
through

khaleefeh

but
he
is

the

of
áŒaeefeh358

er-rasheed
being
informed
of
his
complaint
restored
to
him
his
mistress
and
with
her
his
peace
of
mindâthis
anecdote
is
given
as
a
proof
of
strong
love
but
perhaps
may
not
be
thought
much
to
the
purpose
the
following
from
the
same
work
is
more
apt

during
the
hottest
hour
of
an
excessively
sultry
day
the
khaleefeh
moÃwiyeh
the
son
of
aboo-sufyÃn
was
sitting
in
a
chamber
which
was
open
on
each
side
to
allow
free
passage
to
the
air
when
he
beheld
a
barefooted
bedawee
approaching
him
wondering
what
could
induce
this
man
to
brave
the
scorching
heat
he
declared
to
his
attendants
that
if
he
were
come
to
demand
of
him
any
favour
or
aid
or
act
of
justice
his
request
should
be
granted
the
bedawee
addressed
him
in
verse
with
a
pathetic
appeal
for
justice
against
the
tyranny
of
marwÃn
the
son
of
el-áakam
afterwards
khaleefeh
moÃwiyehs
fourth
successor
by
whom
he
had
been
forcibly
deprived
of
his
beloved
wife
named
soáºdÃ

the
khaleefeh
requiring
a
more
particular
account
of
his
case
he
related
the
following
facts
he
had
a
wife
the
daughter
of
his
paternal
uncle
excessively
beloved
by
him
and
he
possessed
a
number
of
camels
which
enabled
him
to
live
in
comfort
but
a
year
of
terrible
drought
deprived
him
of
his
property
and
reduced
him
to
utter
want
his
friends
deserted
him
and
his
wife
was
taken
away
from
him
by
her
father
to
seek
redress
he
repaired
to
marwÃn
the
governor
of
his
district
at
el-medeeneh
who
having
summoned
the
father
of
his
wife
and
herself
was
so
smitten
by
the
beauty
of
the
woman
that
he
determined
to
obtain
her
for
himself
in
marriage
to
accomplish
which
he
threw
the
husband
into
prison
and
offered
the
father
of
the
woman
a
thousand
deenÃrs
and
ten
thousand
dirhems
for
his
consent
to
his
marriage
with
her
promising
to
compel
her
actual
husband
to
divorce
her
and
this
latter
object
having
obtained
the
fathers
approval
he
gained
by
severely
torturing
the
unfortunate
bedawee
it
would
have
been
vain
for
the
woman
to
attempt
resistance
and
so
she
became
the
wife
of
marwÃnâthe
oppressed
bedawee
having
related
these
circumstances
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
lay
on
the
floor
senseless
coiled
up
like
a
dead
snake
as
soon
as
he
recovered
the
khaleefeh
wrote
a
poetical
epistle
to
marwÃn
severely
reproaching
him
for
his
baseness
and
commanding
him
on
pain
of
death
to
divorce
the
woman
and
send
her
with
his
messenger
she
was
accordingly
divorced
and
sent
with
an
answer
composed
in
the
same
measure
and
rhyme
assuring
the
khaleefeh
that
the
sight
of
soáºdÃ

would
convince
him
that
her
charms
were
irresistible
and
this
proved
too
true
moÃwiyeh
himself
no
sooner
saw
her
than
he
coveted
the
possession
of
her
and
offered
to
give
the
bedawee
if
he
would
resign
her
to
him
three
virgins
from
among
his
female
slaves
together
with
a
thousand
deenÃrs
and
an
ample
annual
pension
the
bedawee
shrieked
with
dismay
as
though
he
had
received
his
death-blow
and
indignantly
rejected
the
offer
the
khaleefeh
then
said
to
him
thou
confessest
that
thou
hast
divorced
her
and
marwÃn
has
married
her
and
acknowledged
that
he
has
divorced
her
we
will
therefore
give
her
her
choice
if
she
desire
any
other
than
thee
as
her
husband
we
will
marry
her
to
him
and
if
she
prefer
thee
we
will
restore
her
to
thee
she
however
preferred
the
destitute
bedawee
and
the
khaleefeh
gave
her
up
to
him
with
a
present
of
ten
thousand
dirhems

numerous
instances
of
unreasonable
love
are
recorded
in
the
writings
of
arabs
it
468is
related
that
a
man
fell
in
love
with
a
female
from
seeing
the
impression
of
her
hand
upon
a
wall
and
being
unable
to
obtain
possession
of
her
died
many
men
are
said
to
have
conceived
a
violent
passion
for
females
seen
in
dreams
others
again
to
have
been
thus
affected
merely
by
the
ear
an
author
relates
his
having
been
acquainted
with
an
accomplished
schoolmaster
who
lost
his
heart
from
hearing
a
man
sing
the
praises
of
a
woman
named
umm-amr
and
two
days
after
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
to
mourn
for
her
death
in
consequence
of
his
hearing
the
same
man
singâ

the
ass
went
away
with
umm-amr
and
she
returned
not
nor
did
the
ass
return359
but
a
few
anecdotes
may
be
considered
as
rare
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
i
think
however
that
strong
evidences
of
the
existence
of
true
love
among
all
classes
of
the
arabs
are
afforded
by
their
very
numerous
tales
of
fiction
descriptive
of
this
passion

may

most
estimable

i

on

the
expression

conformed

great
degree
to
the

not
to
such
an
extent
as
i
consider
necessary
to
obtain
from
them
that
confidence
in
his
sympathy
which
would
induce
them
to
lay
open
to
him
their
character
and
when
a
man
is
often
treated
with
coldness
and
reserve
i
doubt
whether
the
people
from
whom
he
experiences
such
treatment
can
be
judged
by
him
with
strict
impartiality
to
be
received
on
terms
of
equality
by
arabs
of
the
more
polished
classes
an
undeviating
observance
of
their
code
of
etiquette
is
absolutely
indispensable
but
burckhardt
i
have
been
assured
often
violated
this
code
by
practices
harmless
enough
to
our
notions
and
probably
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
arabs
of
the
desert
but
extremely
offensive
to
the
people
who
enjoyed
the
least
share
of
his
esteem
his
most
intimate
acquaintances
in

generally
refused
in

title

yet
the
heaviest
charge

frequent

relating

regarding
the
characteristics

mind
are
entitled
to
the
highest
respect

a
very
remarkable
instance
confirming
mr
lanes
opinion
of
the
existence
of
true
love
among
the
arabs
occurred
during
my
residence
with
him
in
cairo
the
wife
of
a
man
of
good
birth
and
holding
a
high
position
in
that
city
was
accused
of
carrying
on
an
intrigue
while
visiting
the
tombs
of
her
relations
her
family
claimed
her
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
threatened
to
put
her
to
death
as
the
law
would
undoubtedly
have
justified
them
in
doing
if
the
case
were
proved
against
her
her
husband
was
much
attached
to
herâshe
was
his
first
and
only
wifeâand
he
believed
with
reason
that
the
accusation
was
false
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
she
would
in
all
likelihood
find
it
impossible
to
clear
herself
in
a
court
of
law
where
justice
is
only
accidentally
awarded
and
had
good
cause
to
fear
that
her
male
relations
would
put
her
to
death
without
a
hearing
he
therefore
adopted
the
extraordinary
expedient
of
taking
her
secretly
to
the
house
of
a
married
european
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
there
she
remained
concealed
for
some
time
her
husband
visiting
her
daily
and
shewing
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
his
friend
while
the
latter
was
almost
confined
to
one
room
never
venturing
into
the
áareem
without
calling
permission
at
every
few
steps
in
the
mean
time
the
indignation
of
the
ladys
friends
cooled
and
the
affair
was
cleared
up
she
has
since
lived
in
perfect
happiness
with
her
husband

to
any
one
familiar
with
eastern
customs
and
modes
of
thought
a
stronger
proof
of
sincere
love
could
scarcely
be
given
than
that
a
man
should
thus
set
aside
the
strongest
prejudices
of
his
nation
to
save
the
honour
and
perhaps
the
life
of
his
wife
disbelieving
a
report
which
from
its
plausibility
might
have
been
accepted
without
hesitation
the
facilities
afforded
by
the
visits
to
the
cemeteries
are
notorious
and
the
state
of
morals
among
the
women
of
egypt
unfortunately
makes
their
defence
difficult
in
a
suspicious

the

there
was
in
former
times
a
city
behind
the
mountains
of
iápahÃn
called
el-medeeneh
el-khaárÃ
2
and
in
it
resided
a
king
called
the
king
suleymÃn
he
was
a
person
of
liberality
and
beneficence
and
justice
and
integrity
and
of
a
generous
and
obliging
disposition
travellers
repaired
to
him
from
every
quarter
and
his
fame
spread
throughout
all
the
regions
and
countries
and
he
reigned
a
long
time
in
glory
and
security
but
he
was
destitute
of
children
and
of
wives470

he
had
a
wezeer
who
nearly
resembled
him
in
his
qualities
in
liberality
and
other
endowments
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sent
to
this
wezeer
one
day
and
having
summoned
him
into
his
presence
said
to
him
o
wezeer
my
heart
is
contracted
and
my
patience
is
overcome
and
my
strength
is
impaired
because
i
have
neither
a
wife
nor
a
child
this
is
not
the
usual
way
of
kings
who
rule
over
lords
and
poor
men
for
they
rejoice
in
leaving
children
and
multiplying
by
them
the
number
of
their
posterity
and
the
prophet
god
bless
and
save
him
hath
said
intermarry
and
beget
offspring
that
ye
may
increase
in
number
for
i
shall
contend
for
your
superiority
with
the
other
nations
on
the
day
of
resurrectionâwhat
then
is
thy
counsel
o
wezeer
point
out
to
me
what
is
advisableâbut
when
the
wezeer
heard
these
words
tears
poured
from
his
eyes
and
he
replied
far
be
it
from
me
o
king
of
the
age
that
i
should
speak
of
that
which
belongeth
unto
the
compassionate
to
decide3
dost
thou
desire
that
i
should
enter
the
fire
of
hell
through
the
anger
of
the
almighty
kingâknow
o
wezeer
rejoined
his
sovereign
that
if
the
king
purchase
a
female
slave
whose
rank
and
lineage
are
unknown
he
will
not
be
acquainted
with
her
ignoble
origin
that
he
may
abstain
from
her
or
the
nobility
of
her
extraction
that
he
may
make
her
his
companion
so
if
he
do
this
she
may
perhaps
bear
him
a
son
who
may
be
a
hypocrite
a
tyrant
a
shedder
of
blood
and
she
may
resemble
a
marshy
land
the
produce
of
which
is
worthless
and
attaineth
no
excellence
her
child
may
be
obnoxious
to
the
indignation
of
his
lord
not
doing
what
he
commandeth
him
nor
refraining
from
that
which
he
forbiddeth
him
to
do
i
will
never
therefore
be
the
means
of
such
an
event
by
purchasing
a
female
slave
i
desire
rather
that
thou
demand
in
marriage
for
me
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
kings
whose
lineage
is
known
and
whose
loveliness
is
celebrated
if
then
thou
wilt
point
out
to
me
one
of
good
birth
and
of
religion
among
the
daughters
of
the
muslim
kings
i
will
demand
her
as
my
wife
and
marry
her
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
that
i
may
thereby
obtain
the
approval
of
the
lord
of
mankindâthe
wezeer
replied
verily
god
hath
accomplished
thy
want
and
given
thee
thy
desireâhow
so
asked
the
kingâknow
o
king
answered
the
wezeer
that
it
hath
been
told
me
that
the
king
zahr
shÃh
the
sovereign
of
el-ará
el-beyáÃ
4
hath
a
daughter
of
astonishing
loveliness
whom
words
cannot
describe
whose
equal
existeth
not
in
this
age
for
she
is
endowed
with
the
most
perfect
beauty
and
symmetry
with
black
eye
and
long
hair
and
slender
waist
and
large
hips
when
she
approach471eth
she
seduceth
and
when
she
turneth
her
back
she
killeth
ravishing
the
heart
and
the
eye
it
is
my
opinion
therefore
o
king
that
thou
shouldst
send
to
her
father
an
intelligent
messenger
well-informed
and
experienced
in
the
course
of
events
that
he
may
courteously
ask
her
in
marriage
for
thee
of
her
father
for
she
hath
no
equal
in
the
distant
parts
of
the
earth
nor
in
the
near
so
shalt
thou
enjoy
her
lovely
face
and
the
glorious
king
shall
approve
thy
conduct
since
it
hath
been
handed
down
from
the
prophet
god
bless
and
save
him
that
he
said
there
is
no
monkery
in
el-islÃm

upon
this
the
king
was
perfectly
delighted
his
bosom
expanded
with
joy
and
anxiety
and
grief
departed
from
him
and
addressing
his
wezeer
he
said
to
him
know
o
wezeer
that
no
one
shall
go
on
this
business
but
thou
on
account
of
thy
consummate
wisdom
and
politeness
depart
therefore
to
thy
house
and
accomplish
what
thou
hast
to
do
and
prepare
thyself
by
the
morrow
and
demand
for
me
in
marriage
this
damsel
with
whom
thou
hast
caused
my
heart
to
be
engrossed
and
return
not
to
me
without
her
the
wezeer
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
went
to
his
house
and
gave
orders
to
bring
presents
suitable
to
kings
consisting
of
costly
jewels
and
precious
rarities
such
as
were
light
to
carry
and
of
great
value
together
with
arab
horses
and
davidean
coats
of
mail5
and
chests
of
wealth
such
as
language
would
fail
to
describe
these
they
placed
upon
the
mules
and
camels
and
the
wezeer
departed
accompanied
by
a
hundred
memlooks
and
a
hundred
male
black
slaves
and
a
hundred
female
slaves
and
the
flags
and
banners
were
unfurled
over
his
head
the
king
charged
him
to
return
soon
and
after
his
departure
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
burned
with
desire
and
became
engrossed
with
love
of
the
damsel
night
and
day
meanwhile
the
wezeer
by
night
and
by
day
traversed
the
deserts
and
wastes
until
there
remained
between
him
and
the
city
to
which
he
was
repairing
one
days
journey
when
he
alighted
at
the
bank
of
a
river
and
having
summoned
one
of
his
chief
officers
ordered
him
to
go
quickly
to
the
king
zahr
shÃh
and
to
acquaint
him
with
his
approach
he
answered
i
hear
and
obeyâand
went
quickly
to
the
city
and
when
he
arrived
there
it
happened
that
the
king
zahr
shÃh
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
places
of
recreation
before
the
gate
of
the
city
and
seeing
him
as
he
entered
knew
him
to
be
a
stranger
and
summoned
him
before
him
so
when
the
messenger
came
to
him
he
informed
him
of
the
approach
of
the
wezeer
of
the
supreme
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
the
king
of
el-ará
el-khaárÃ

and
of
the
mountains
of
iápahÃn
and
the
king
zahr472
shÃh
rejoiced
and
welcomed
the
messenger
and
having
conducted
him
to
his
palace
said
to
him
where
didst
thou
part
from
the
wezeer
he
answered
i
parted
from
him
in
the
morning
at
the
bank
of
such
a
river
and
to-morrow
he
will
arrive
and
visit
thee
may
god
continue
his
favours
unto
thee
and
show
mercy
unto
thy
parents6
zahr
shÃh
then
ordered
one
of
his
wezeers
to
take
with
him
the
greater
number
of
his
chief
officers
and
chamberlains
and
lieutenants
and
the
lords
of
his
court
and
to
go
forth
with
them
to
meet
him
in
honour
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
for
his
dominion
extended
through
the
land

in
the
mean
time
the
wezeer
of
suleymÃn
shÃh
remained
where
he
had
halted
until
midnight
and
then
proceeded
towards
the
city
and
when
the
morning
gleamed
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
hills
and
the
lowlands
suddenly
the
wezeer
of
the
king
zahr
shÃh
and
his
chamberlains
and
the
lords
of
his
court
and
the
chief
officers
of
his
kingdom
approached
and
joined
him
at
the
distance
of
some
leagues
from
the
city
so
the
wezeer
of
suleymÃn
shÃh
felt
sure
of
the
accomplishment
of
his
business
and
saluted
those
who
met
him
and
the
latter
preceded
him
until
they
arrived
at
the
palace
of
the
king
and
passed
in
before
him
through
the
entrance
to
the
seventh
vestibule
this
was
the
place
which
no
one
entered
on
horseback
for
it
was
near
to
the
king
therefore
here
the
wezeer
alighted
and
he
proceeded
on
foot
until
he
came
to
a
lofty
saloon
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
a
couch
of
alabaster
set
with
pearls
and
jewels
having
four
legs
of
elephants
tusks
and
upon
it
was
a
mattress
covered
with
green
satin
embroidered
with
red
gold
and
over
it
was
a
canopy
adorned
with
pearls
and
jewels
upon
this
couch
sat
the
king
zahr
shÃh
and
the
lords
of
his
court
stood
in
attendance
upon
him
and
when
the
wezeer
went
in
unto
him
and
stood
before
him
he
composed
his
heart
and
gave
liberty
to
his
tongue
and
displaying
the
oratory
of
wezeers
and
uttering
the
language
of
the
eloquent
addressed
the
king
with
courtesy
of
manner
and
recited
a
series
of
complimentary
verses
and
when
he
had
finished
the
king
caused
him
to
draw
near
treated
him
with
the
utmost
respect
and
seating
him
by
his
side
smiled
in
his
face
and
honoured
him
with
a
gracious
reply
after
this
the
attendants
brought
forward
the
table
in
that
saloon
and
they
ate
until
they
were
satisfied
when
the
attendants
removed
the
table
and
every
one
who
was
present
went
forth
except
the
chief
officers
when
the
wezeer
therefore
saw
that
they
had
quitted
the
hall
he
rose
and
stood
on
his
feet
and
complimenting
the473
king
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
said
o
great
king
and
dignified
sovereign
i
have
come
unto
thee
and
visited
thee
on
an
affair
productive
of
peace
and
prosperity
and
happiness
unto
thee
and
it
is
this
i
have
come
to
thee
as
an
ambassador
to
desire
in
marriage
thy
daughter
the
distinguished
by
rank
and
lineage
from
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
who
is
endowed
with
justice
and
integrity
and
graciousness
and
beneficence
the
king
of
el-ará
el-khaárÃ

and
of
the
mountains
of

and
he
hath
sent
unto
thee
many
presents
and
numerous
rarities
desiring
thine
alliance
dost
thou
then
wish
the
same
of
himâhe
then
stood
silent
waiting
for
the
answer
and
when
the
king
zahr
shÃh
heard
these
words
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
modestly
kissed
the
ground
and
the
persons
who
were
present
wondered
at
the
kings
condescension
to
the
ambassador474
and
their
minds
were
amazed
the
king
then
offered
up
praises
unto
him
who
is
possessed
of
glory
and
honour
and
said
still
standing
o
exalted
wezeer
and
illustrious
lord
hear
what
i
say
we
are
unto
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
among
the
number
of
his
subjects
and
shall
be
ennobled
by
his
affinity
we
covet
this
distinction
and
my
daughter
is
one
of
his
handmaids
this
is
my
greatest
desire
that
he
may
be
a
means
of
support
to
me
and
my
relianceâand
he
summoned
the
áÃáees
and
witnesses
and
they
bore
witness
that
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
had
appointed
his
wezeer
as
his
deputy
to
effect
the
marriage
and
the
king
zahr
shÃh
joyfully
officiated
for
his
daughter
in
performing
the
contract
so
the
áÃáees
concluded
the
marriage-contract
and
offered
up
a
prayer
for
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
both
parties
after
which
the
wezeer
arose
and
produced
the
presents
and
precious
rarities
and
all
the
gifts
that
he
had
brought
and
offered
the
whole
to
the
king

zahr
shÃh
on
his
throne
the
king
then
occupied
himself
in
fitting
out
his
daughter
and
in
honourably
entertaining
the
wezeer
and
he
feasted
at
his
banquets
the
great
and
the
abject
and
continued
the
festivity
for
a
period
of
two
months
omitting
in
it
nothing
that
would
rejoice
the
heart
and
the
eye7
and
when
everything
that
the
bride
required
was
completed
the
king
gave
orders
to
carry
forth
the
tents
and
they
were
pitched
outside
the
city
they
packed
the
stuffs
in
the
chests
and
made
ready
the
greek
and
turkish
female
slaves
and
the
king
provided
the
bride
with
precious
treasures
and
costly
jewels
and
made
for
her
a
litter8
of
red
gold
adorned
with
pearls
and
jewels
appropriating
to
her
use
ten
mules
for
the
journey
the
litter
appeared
like
a
private
chamber
and
its
occupant
like

of

beautiful

her
canopy
resembling
one
of
the
pavilions
of

they
packed
up
the
treasures
and
wealth
and
placed
them
upon
the
mules

camels
and
the
king
zahr

went
with
them
to
the
distance
of
three
leagues
and
then
bade
farewell
to
his
daughter
and
the
wezeer
and
his
attendants
and
returned
home
in
joy
and

the
wezeer
proceeded
with
the

continued
his
days

and
his
route
over

travelling
with
diligence
by
night

until
there
remained
between

he
sent

upon
the
messenger
and
ordered
his
troops
to
go
forth
in
grand
procession
to
meet
the
bride
and
her
attendants
with
honour
desiring
them
to
equip
themselves
in
the
gayest
manner
and
to
unfurl
the
standards
over
their
heads
and
they
complied
with
his
commands
and
a
crier
proclaimed
through
the
city
that
no
curtained
damsel
nor
honoured
lady
nor
infirm
old
woman
should
fail
to
go
forth
to
meet
the
bride
so
they
all
went
forth
to
meet
her
and
the
chief
among
them
accompanied
her
to
serve
her
they
decided
together
to
conduct
her
towards
night
to
the
kings
palace
and
the
chief
officers
of
the
court
agreed
to
decorate
the
streets
and
to
stand
while
the
bride
passed
by
them
with
the
eunuchs
and
female
slaves
before
her
she
herself
being
clad
in
the
dress
which
her
father
gave
her
and
when
she
approached
the
troops
surrounded
her
ranged
on
the
right
and
left
and
the
litter
advanced
with
her
until
it
drew
near
to
the
palace
and
there
was
no
one
who
did
not
come
forth
to
see
it
the
drums
were
beaten
and
the
spears
brandished
and
the
trumpets
sounded
and
sweet
odours
were
diffused
around
and
the
standards
flapped
and
the
horses
raced
with
each
other
until
they
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
when
the
pages
advanced
with
the
litter
to
the
entrance
of

the
troops
of
suleymÃn
shÃh
meeting
his
bride
the
áareem
the
palace
was
illuminated
by
its
splendour
and
its
walls
shone
with
the
lustre
of
its
ornaments
and
at
night
the
eunuchs
opened
the
doors
of
the
inner
apartment
and
stood
surrounding
the
chief
entrance
the
bride476
then
came
forward
among
the
female
slaves
like
the
moon
among
the
stars
or
the
chief
pearl
among
the
minor
pearls
of
the
string
and
she
entered
the
apartment
where
they
had
placed
for
her
a
couch
of
alabaster
set
with
pearls
and
jewels
upon
this
she
seated
herself
and
the
king
came
in
to
visit
her
and
god
inspired
his
heart
with
love
for
her
so
that
his
disquietude
and
trouble
ceased

he
remained
with
her
about
a
month
after
which
he
went
forth
and
sat
upon
his
throne
and
administered
justice
to
his
subjects
and
towards
daybreak
on
the
morning
after
the
expiration
of
the
ninth
month
his
wife
gave
birth
to
a
male
child
of
an
auspicious
appearance
when
the
king
heard
of
it
he
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
gave
a
large
sum
of
money
to
the
bearer
of
the
good
tidings
and
in
his
joy
he
went
to
the
child
and
kissed
him
between
the
eyes
wondering
at
his
surpassing
beauty
the
midwives
took
him
and
blackened
the
edges
of
his
eyelids
with
koál10
and
they
named
him
tÃj-el-mulook
khÃrÃn11
he
was
nourished
on
the
bosom
of
indulgence
and
reared
in
the
lap
of
prosperity
and
days
and
years
passed
until
he
attained
the
age
of
seven
years
whereupon
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
summoned
the
men
of
learning
and
science
and
ordered
them
to
instruct
his
son
in
writing
and
science
and
polite
literature
and
they
continued
to
do
so
for
some
years
until
he
had
learnt
what
was
requisite
and
when
he
was
acquainted
with
all
that
the
king
desired
he
caused
him
to
be
brought
from
the
professors
and
teachers
and
engaged
for
him
a
master
to
instruct
him
in
horsemanship
who
continued
to
teach
him
until
his
pupil
was
fourteen
years
of
age
whenever
the
youth
went
forth
on
any
business
every
one
who
beheld
him
was
ravished
by
his
beauty
so
that
they
composed
verses
in
his
praise
and
even
the
women
of
virtue
were
overcome
by
love
for
him
through
the
surpassing
beauty
with
which
he
was
endowed
and
when
he
had
attained
the
age
of
eighteen
years
the
grey
down
appeared
upon
a
mole
on
his
red
cheek
while
another
mole
like
a
globule
of
ambergris
added
to
these
charms
and
he
captivated
the
minds
and
eyes
of
his
beholders
his
comeliness
increased
as
he
became
a
man
and
he
had
companions
and
friends
and
every
one
who
enjoyed
access
to
him
wished
that
tÃj-el-mulook
might
be
suláÃn
after
the
death
of
his
father
and
that
he
might
himself
be
one
of
his
emeers

now
tÃj-el-mulook
became
addicted
to
hunting
and
would
not
desist
from
it
for
a
single
hour
his
father
the
king
used
to
forbid
him
this
pursuit
fearing
on
his
account
the
perils
of
the
desert
and
the
wild
beasts
but
he
would
not
receive
his
warnings
and
it
came477

tÃj-el-mulook
hunting
to
pass
that
he
said
to
his
servants
take
with
you
provender
for
ten
days
and
they
complied
with
his
order
and
when
he
went
forth
with
his
followers
to
the
chase
they
proceeded
over
the
desert
and
continued
their
course
for
four
days
until
they
came
in
sight
of
a
verdant
tract
where
they
beheld
wild
beasts
ranging
at
large
and
trees
with
ripe
fruit
and
springs
gushing
forth
so
he
said
to
his
followers
set
here
the
nets
and
enlarge
their
circle
and
our
place
of
meeting
shall
be
at
the
extremity
of
the
circle
at
such
a
spot
they
therefore
obeyed
his
commands

tÃj-el-mulook
hunting
tÃj-el-mulook
hunting
they
set
the
nets
and
enlarged
their
circle
and
there
collected
within
them
an
abundance
and
a
variety
of
wild
beasts
and
gazelles
in
such
numbers
that
the
wild
beasts
cried
out
in
fear
of
them
and
threw
themselves
in
the
faces
of
the
horses
in
their
attempts
to
escape
so
he
urged
the
dogs
and
the
lynxes12
and
the
hawks
at
them
and
they
shot
the
wild
beasts
with
arrows
striking
them
in
mortal
places
and
they
arrived
not
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
circle
without
having
taken
of
the
wild
beasts
a
great
number
the
rest
having
fled
away
tÃj-el-mulook
then
alighted
at
some
water
and
having
caused
the
game
to
be
brought
before
him478
divided
it
he
appropriated
to
his
father
suleymÃn
shÃh
the
best
of
the
beasts
and
despatched
the
portion
to
him
and
some
he
distributed
among
the
officers
of
his
court

they
passed
the
night
at
that
place
and
in
the
morning
there
approached
them
a
great
caravan
comprising
black
slaves
and
servants
and
merchants
the
caravan
halted
at
the
water
and
the
verdant
tract
and
when
tÃj-el-mulook
beheld
them
he
said
to
one
of
his
companions
bring
me
an
account
of
these
people
and
ask
them
wherefore
they
have
halted
in
this
place
and
when
the
messenger
went
to
them
he
said
to
them
inform
us
who
ye
are
and
return
an
answer
quickly
so
they
replied
we
are
merchants
and
have
halted
here
for
the
sake
of
rest
for
the
next
station
is
distant
from
us
and
we
have
halted
in
this
place
because
we
here
enjoy
tranquillity
under
the
protection
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
and
his
son
for
we
know
that
every
one
who
alighteth
in
his
dominions
is
in
safety
and
peace
and
we
have
some
precious
stuffs
which
we
have
brought
on
account
of
his
son
tÃj-el-mulook
the
messenger
therefore
returned
to
the
kings
son
and
acquainted
him
with
the
truth
of
the
matter
informing
him
of
what
he
had
heard
from
the
merchants
and
the
kings
son
said
if
they
have
anything
which
they
have
brought
on
my
account
i
will
not
enter
the
city
nor
remove
from
this
place
until
i
cause
it
to
be
displayed
before
me
he
then
mounted
his
horse
and
proceeded
his
memlooks
following
him
until
he
drew
near
to
the
caravan
and
the
merchants
rose
to
him
and
greeted
him
with
prayers
for
the
divine
aid
and
favour
and
the
continuance
of
his
glory
and
his
excellencies
a
tent
of
red
satin
embroidered
with
pearls
and
jewels
was
pitched
for
him
and
they
spread
for
him
over
a
carpet
of
silk
a
royal
carpet
the
upper
end
of
which
was
adorned
with
emeralds
and
tÃj-el-mulook
seated
himself
and
the
memlooks
stood
waiting
upon
him
and
he
sent
to
the
merchants
commanding
them
to
bring
everything
that
they
had
with
them
so
they
approached
him
with
their
merchandise
and
he
caused
all
of
it
to
be
displayed
before
him
and
took
of
it
what
suited
him
and
gave
them
the
price

after
this
he
mounted
and
was
about
to
depart
when
casting
a
glance
at
the
caravan
he
saw
a
young
man
a
comely
youth
attired
in
clean
clothes
of
elegant
person
with
shining
forehead
and
brilliant
countenance
but
the
charms
of
this
youth
had
suffered
a
change
and
paleness
had
overspread
him
in
consequence
of
his
separation
from
the
objects
of
his
affection
great
was
his
groaning
and
lamentation
and
with
tears
flowing
from
his
eyes
he
recited
these
verses479â

our
separation
is
protracted
and
anxiety
and
fear
are
prolonged
and
tears
from
my
eye
o
my
friend
are
flowing
i
bade
farewell
to
my
heart
on
the
day
of
parting
and
now
i
am
alone
without
heart
and
without
hope
o
my
friend
pause
with
me
while
i
bid
her
farewell
by
whose
voice
diseases
and
infirmities
would
be
cured
having
thus
said
he
wept
a
while
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
while
tÃj-el-mulook
looked
at
him
wondering
at
his
case
and
when
he
recovered
he
stared
with
a
bold
look
and
again
recited
some
verses
commencing
thusâ

beware
of
her
eye
for
it
is
enchanting
and
none
escapeth
upon
whom
it
is
cast
he
then
uttered
a
loud
sigh
and
a
second
time
swooned
and
when
tÃj-el-mulook
beheld
him
in
this
state
he
was
perplexed
at
his
case
and
walked
towards
him
and
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
his
fit
he
saw
the
kings
son
standing
at
his
head
whereupon
he
rose
upon
his
feet
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
him
wherefore
hast
thou
not
displayed
thy
merchandise
to
usâo
my
lord
he
answered
my
merchandise
compriseth
nothing
suitable
to
thy
highness
but
the
kings
son
said
thou
must
positively
shew
me
what
thou
hast
and
acquaint
me
with
thy
circumstances
for
i
see
thee
with
weeping
eye
and
mourning
heart
and
if
thou
be
oppressed
we
will
put
an
end
to
the
oppression
that
thou
sufferest
and
if
thou
be
in
debt
we
will
discharge
thy
debt
for
my
heart
hath
been
tormented
on
thine
account
since
i
first
beheld
thee

then
tÃj-el-mulook
gave
orders
to
place
a
chair
and
they
set
for
him
a
chair
of
ivory
and
ebony
ornamented
with
reticulated
work
of
gold
and
silk
and
they
spread
for
him
a
silken
carpet
and
tÃj-el-mulook
seated
himself
upon
the
chair
and
commanded
the
young
man
to
sit
upon
the
carpet
and
said
to
him
display
to
me
thy
merchandise
the
young
man
replied
o
my
lord
mention
it
not
unto
me
for
my
merchandise
is
not
suitable
to
thee
but
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
him
it
must
be
doneâand
ordered
some
of
his
pages
to
bring
it
so
they
brought
it
in
spite
of
him
and
when
the
young
man
beheld
it
his
tears
flowed
and
he
wept
and
sighed
and
lamented
and
groans
rose
from
his
throat
after
again
repeating
some
verses
he
opened
his
merchandise
and
displayed
it
before
tÃj-el-mulook
portion
by
portion
and
piece
by
piece
and
took
forth
from
among
it
a
garment
of
satin
interwoven
with
gold
worth
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
when
he
opened
this
there
fell
from
the
midst
of
it
a
piece480
of
linen
and
the
young
man
snatching
it
hastily
put
it
beneath
him
his
reason
wandering
and
thus
exclaimedâ

when
will
the
tortured
heart
be
healed
by
thee
the
constellation
of
the
pleiades
is
nearer
to
me
than
thou
tÃj-el-mulook
was
struck
with
the
utmost
wonder
at
his
words
not
knowing
the
cause
of
them
and
when
the
young
man
took
the
piece
of
linen
and
put
it
beneath
him
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
him
what
is
this
piece
of
linen
he
answered
o
my
lord
thou
hast
no
interest
in
this
but
the
kings
son
said
shew
it
to
meâo
my
lord
he
replied
i
refrained
not
from
exposing
to
thee
my
merchandise
but
on
account
of
this
for
i
cannot
allow
thee
to
see
it
tÃj-el-mulook
however
said
i
must
see
itâand
he
urged
him
and
was
angry
the
young
man
therefore
took
it
from
beneath
his
knee
and
wept
and
sighed
and
lamented
exceedingly
so
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
him
i
regard
thy
conduct
as
not
right
acquaint
me
then
with
the
cause
of
thy
weeping
at
beholding
this
piece
of
linen
and
when
the
young
man
heard
the
mention
of
the
piece
of
linen
he
sighed
and
said
o
my
lord
my
story
is
wonderful
and
my
case
is
strange
with
respect
to
this
piece
of
linen
and
her
to
whom
it
belonged
and
her
who
designed
these
figures
and
emblems
he
then
unfolded
the
piece
of
linen
and
lo
in
it
was
the
figure
of
a
gazelle
worked
with
silk
and
embroidered
with
red
gold
and
facing
it
was
the
figure
of
another
gazelle
worked
with
silver
and
having
upon
its
neck
a
ring
of
red
gold
and
three
áaáabehs13
of
chrysolite
when
tÃj-el-mulook
beheld
this
and
observed
the
beauty
of
its
execution
he
exclaimed
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
god
who
hath
taught
man
that
which
he
knew
not14
and
his
heart
was
engrossed
with
desire
to
hear
the
story
of
this
young
man
so
he
said
to
him
relate
to
me
the
story
of
thyself
and
of
her
who
was
the
owner
of
these
gazelles
the
young
man
therefore
repliedâ

the
story
of
azeez
and
azeezeh

know
o
my
lord
that
my
father
was
a
great
merchant
and
he
was
blest
with
no
child
but
me
i
had
a
cousin
the
daughter
of
a
paternal
uncle
with
whom
i
was
brought
up
in
my
fathers
house
for
her
father
had
died
and
before
his
death
he
had
made
an
agreement
with
my
father
that
they
should
marry
me
to
her
so
when
i
had
attained
to
manhood
and
she
to
womanhood
they
did
not
exclude481
her
from
me
nor
me
from
her
my
father
then
spoke
to
my
mother
and
said
to
her
this
year
we
will
perform
the
marriage-contract
of
azeez
and
azeezeh15
and
having
agreed
with
my
mother
to
do
this
he
began
to
make
ready
the
provisions
for
the
entertainments

all
this
was
done
while
i
and
my
cousin
were
living
together
without
the
slightest
restraint
and
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
and
she
was
more
intelligent
and
more
knowing
than
i
and
when
my
father
had
made
the
preparations
for
the
festivity
and
nothing
remained
but
the
performance
of
the
contract
and
my
union
to
my
cousin
my
father
proposed
that
they
should
perform
the
contract
after
the
friday-prayers
so
he
repaired
to
his
friends
the
merchants
and
others
and
acquainted
them
with
his
intention
and
my
mother
went
and
invited
her
female
friends
and
relations
and
when
the
friday
came
they
washed
the
saloon
which
was
appropriated
to
the
guests
and
cleansed
its
marble
pavement
and
spread
the
carpets
in
our
house
and
furnished
it
with
everything
that
was
requisite
after
they
had
decorated
its
walls
with
stuffs
interwoven
with
gold
the
people
having
agreed
to
pay
their
compliments
to
our
family
after
the
friday-prayers
my
father
then
went
and
caused
sweetmeats
and
dishes
of
sugar
to
be
prepared
and
there
remained
nothing
but
the
performance
of
the
contract
my
mother
had
sent
me
to
the
bath
and
sent
after
me
a
new
suit
of
clothes
of
the
richest
description
and
on
my
coming
out
from
the
bath
i
put
on
this
handsome
suit
which
was
perfumed
and
when
i
put
it
on
a
delicious
odour
was
diffused
from
it
and
left
a
fragrance
in
the
way

descent
of
the
handkerchief
i
desired
now
to
repair
to
the
mosque
but
remembering
one
of
my
friends
i
returned
to
search
for
him
that
he
might
be
present
at
the
ceremony
of
the
contract
saying
within
myself
i
will
busy
me
with
this
affair
until
the
time
of
prayer
draws
near
i
then
entered
a
by-street
which
i
had
never
entered
before
i
was
perspiring
from
the
effect
of
the
bath
and
the
new
clothes
which
i
wore
and
the
moisture
dropped
from
me
while
my
perfumes
diffused
their
odour
so
i
seated
myself
at
the
upper
end
of
the
street
to
take
rest
upon
a
maááabah
and
spread
beneath
me
an
embroidered
handkerchief
that
i
had
with
me
the
heat
became
oppressive
to
me
and
my
forehead
perspired
and
the
drops
ran
down
my
face
and
i
could
not
wipe
the
moisture
from
it
with
my
handkerchief
because
it
was
spread
beneath
me
i
was
therefore
about
to
take
the
skirt
of
my
farajeeyeh
to
wipe
with
it
my
cheek
when
suddenly
a
white
handkerchief
fell
upon
me
from
above
this
handkerchief
was
more
delicate
to
the
feel
than
the482
zephyr
and
the
sight
of
it
was
more
pleasant
than
restoration
to
the
diseased
and
i
took
it
in
my
hand
and
raising
my
head
to
see
whence
it
had
fallen
my
eye
met
the
eye
of
the
female
who
owned
these
gazelles
and
lo
she
was
looking
out
from
a
lattice
in
a
window
of
brass
my
eye
never
beheld
a
person
more
lovely
and
altogether
her
charms
were
such
as
the
tongue
cannot
describe
and
when
she
saw
me
looking
at
her
she
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
then
united
her
middle
finger
and
her
fore
finger
and
placed
them
upon
her
bosom
after
which
she
drew
in
her
head
from
the
window
and
shut
the
lattice
and
withdrew
a
fire
had
been
darted
into
my
heart
and
the
flame
increased
the
sight
drew
from
me
a
thousand
sighs483
and
i
was
perplexed
for
i
heard
not
anything
from
her
and
understood
not
what
she
meant
by
her
signs
i
looked
again
towards
the
window
but
found
it
closed
and
i
waited
until
sunset
but
heard
no
sound
nor
saw
any
person
so
despairing
of
seeing
her
again
i
rose
from
my
place
and
took
the
handkerchief
with
me
i
opened
it
and
the
odour
of
musk
was
diffused
from
it
and
i
was
so
exhilarated
by
the
scent
that
i
seemed
as
if
i
were
in
paradise
i
then
spread
it
before
me
whereupon
there
fell
from
it
a
piece
of
delicate
paper
and
opening
this
i
found
it
richly
perfumed
with
exquisite
scents
and
inscribed
with
these
versesâ

i
sent
a
letter
to
complain
to
him
of
the
pain
of
my
passion
in
a
delicate
handwriting
for
handwritings
are
various
so
my
beloved
said
wherefore
is
thy
writing
thus
delicate
and
minute
so
as
scarce
to
be
discernible
i
answered
because
i
am
wasted
and
attenuated
so
therefore
should
the
writing
of
lovers
be
after
this
i
cast
a
glance
at
the
beauty
of
the
handkerchief
and
beheld
an
amatory
couplet
worked
upon
one
of
its
two
borders16
and
another
of
a
similar
kind
on
its
other
border

when
i
saw
these
verses
upon
the
handkerchief
a
flame
of
fire
shot
into
my
heart
and
my
desire
and
perplexity
increased
and
i
took
the
handkerchief
and
the
paper
and
went
with
them
to
the
house
not
knowing
any
means
of
obtaining
what
i
desired
and
incapable
of
discovering
how
to
proceed
properly
in
my
love
i
arrived
not
at
the
house
until
a
considerable
portion
of
the
night
had
elapsed
and
beheld
my
cousin
sitting
weeping
but
when
she
saw
me
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
approached
me
and
took
off
from
me
my
outer
clothes
and
asked
me
the
cause
of
my
absence
she
told
me
that
all
the
people
the
emeers
and
grandees
and
merchants
and
others
had
assembled
in
our
house
and
the
áÃáee
and
the
witnesses
had
come
and
they
ate
the
repast
and
remained
a
considerable
while
sitting
in
expectation
of
my
presence
for
the
purpose
of
performing
the
marriage-contract
and
when
they
despaired
of
my
coming
they
dispersed
and
went
their
waysâthy
father
said
she
was
violently
enraged
on
account
of
this
and
swore
that
he
would
not
perform
our
marriage-contract
until
next
year
for
he
hath
expended
upon
this
festivity
a
large
sum
of
money
what
she
added
hath
happened
unto
thee
this
day
that
thou
hast
delayed
thy
return
until
now
and
that
this
hath
happened
on
account
of
thine
absence

i
answered
her
such
and
such
things
have
happened
to
meâand484
mentioned
to
her
the
handkerchief
acquainting
her
with
the
affair
from
first
to
last
and
she
took
the
paper
and
the
handkerchief
and
read
what
was
upon
them
and
her
tears
ran
down
upon
her
cheeks
and
she
asked
me
what
did
she
say
to
thee
and
of
what
did
she
make
signs
to
thee
i
answered
she
uttered
not
a
word
but
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
then
united
it
with
the
middle
finger
and
placed
both
fingers
upon
her
bosom
and
pointed
to
the
ground
then
she
drew
in
her
head
and
closed
the
lattice
and
i
saw
her
not
afterwards
she
carried
off
my
heart
with
her
and
i
sat
until
sunset
in
expectation
of
her
looking
out
from
the
lattice
a
second
time
but
she
did
it
not
and
when
i
despaired
of
seeing
her
again
i
rose
from
the
place
this
is
my
story
and
i
beg
of
thee
to
aid
me
in
the
trouble
in
which
i
am
involvedâupon
this
she
raised
her
head
towards
me
and
said
o
son
of
my
uncle
if
thou
requiredst
mine
eye
i
would
pull
it
out
for
thee
from
my
eyelids
and
i
must
assist
thee
in
the
accomplishment
of
thy
desire
and
assist
her
in
like
manner
for
she
is
overwhelmed
by
love
for
thee
as
thou
art
by
love
for
herâand
what
said
i
is
the
interpretation
of
the
signs
which
she
madeâher
putting
her
finger
in
her
mouth
she
answered
indicateth
that
thou
art
in
her
estimation
as
her
soul
to
her
body17
and
that
she
longeth
for
thy
union
with
her
and
as
to
the
handkerchief
it
is
a
signal
of
the
lovers
salutation
to
the
beloved
and
the
paper
denoteth
that
her
soul
is
captivated
by
thee
and
as
to
her
putting
her
two
fingers
upon
her
bosom
the
meaning
of
it
is
as
though
she
said
to
thee
after
two
days
come
hither
that
my
affliction
may
be
dissipated
by
thy
countenance18
and
know
o
son
of
my
uncle
she
continued
that
she
loveth
thee
and
confideth
in
thee
this
is
my
interpretation
of
her
signs
and
if
i
had
liberty
to
go
in
and
out
at
pleasure
i
would
effect
thy
union
with
her
in
the
shortest
time
and
protect
you
both
with
my
skirtâwhen
i
heard
these
words
from
her
said
the
young
man
i
thanked
her
for
what
she
had
said
and
i
said
within
myself
i
will
wait
two
days
i
then
remained
two
days
in
the
house
neither
going
out
nor
coming
in
nor
eating
nor
drinking
i
put
my
head
in
the
lap
of
my
cousin
and
she
cheered
me
by
her
conversation
and
said
to
me
be
resolute
and
of
good
heart
and
dress
thyself
and
repair
to
her
at
the
time
appointed
and
she
arose
and
changed
my
clothes
and
perfumed
me
with
incense

i
then
braced
up
my
nerves
and
fortified
my
heart
and
went
forth
and
proceeded
until
i
entered
the
by-street
and
after
i
had
sat
a
while
upon
the
maááabah
lo
the
lattice
opened
i
looked
towards
the485
damsel
and
when
i
saw
her
i
fell
down
in
a
swoon
then
recovering
i
summoned
resolution
and
took
heart
and
looked
at
her
a
second
time
but
again
i
became
insensible
and
when
i
recovered
i
saw
with
her
a
mirror
and
a
red
handkerchief
observing
me
now
she
tucked
up
her
sleeves
from
her
fore
arms
and
opening
her
five
fingers
struck
her
bosom
with
them
with
the
palm
and
the
five
fingers
next
she
raised
her
hands
and
held
forth
the
mirror
from
the
lattice
and
took
the
red
handkerchief
and
retired
with
it
after
which
she
returned
and
let
it
down
from
the
lattice
towards
the
street
three
times
letting
it
down
and
raising
it
and
then
wringing
it
and
twisting
it
with
her
hand
and
bending
down
her
head
she
then
drew
it
in
through
the
lattice
and
closed
the
lattice
and
departed
without
speaking
to
me
one
word
but
leaving
me
in
perplexity
not
knowing
to
what
she
alluded
i
remained
sitting
there
until
the
hour
of
nightfall
and
went
home
near
midnight

azeez
and
azeezeh
i
found
my
cousin
with
her
hand
placed
to
her
cheek
and
her
eyelids
pouring
forth
tears
and
upon
this
my
anxieties
and
griefs
increased
and
i
fell
down
in
a
corner
of
the
chamber
but
she
sprang
towards
me
and
lifted
me
up
and
having
taken
off
from
me
my
outer
clothes
wiped
my
face
with
her
sleeve
and
asked
me
what
had486
happened
to
me
i
related
to
her
therefore
all
that
had
happened
on
the
part
of
the
damsel
and
she
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
as
to
her
sign
with
her
hand
and
five
fingers
its
interpretation
is
come
hither
after
five
daysâand
as
to
her
sign
with
the
mirror
and
her
putting
forth
her
head
from
the
lattice
and
her
actions
with
the
red
handkerchief19
the
meaning
is
seat
thyself
at
the
shop
of
the
dyer
until
my
messenger
shall
come
to
theeâwhen
i
heard
her
words
fire
burned
in
my
heart
and
i
replied
by
allah
o
daughter
of
my
uncle
thou
sayest
truly
in
this
interpretation
for
i
saw
in
the
by-street
a
jewish
dyer
i
then
wept
and
my
cousin
said
be
resolute
and
firm
of
heart
for
others
than
thou
are
troubled
with
love
for
a
period
of
years
and
contend
with
the
fierceness
of
passion
while
thou
hast
but
a
week
to
endure
wherefore
then
should
this
impatience
overcome
thee
and
she
proceeded
to
cheer
me
with
her
conversation
and
brought
me
food
and
i
took
a
morsel
and
would
have
eaten
it
but
i
could
not
i
abstained
from
drink
and
food
and
renounced
the
delights
of
sleep
and
my
complexion
became
pallid
and
my
charms
became
changed
for
i
had
never
known
love
before
that
nor
tasted
the
fervency
of
that
passion
before
and
i
fell
sick
and
my
cousin
became
sick
on
my
account
she
occupied
herself
in
relating
to
me
the
sufferings
of
lovers
in
order
to
enliven
me
until
i
fell
asleep
and
i
used
to
awake
and
find
her
sleepless
on
my
account
with
her
tears
flowing
upon
her
cheeks
and
thus
i
remained
until
the
five
days
had
passed
when
my
cousin
arose
and
heated
some
water
for
me
and
bathed
me
with
it
and
dressed
me
and
said
to
me
repair
to
her
and
may
allah
accomplish
thy
wish
and
grant
thee
what
thou
desirest
of
thy
beloved

so
i
went
and
walked
on
until
i
came
to
the
upper
end
of
the
by-street
and
that
day
was
saturday
so
i
found
the
shop
of
the
dyer
shut
and
i
sat
there
till
the
call
to
afternoon-prayers
and
the
sun
became
yellow
and
the
call
to
evening-prayers
was
chanted
and
night
commenced
and
i
saw
no
trace
of
her
nor
heard
a
voice
nor
received
any
message
i
therefore
feared
for
myself
sitting
alone
and
i
rose
and
walked
away
like
one
intoxicated
until
i
entered
the
house

there
on
going
in
i
beheld
my
cousin
azeezeh
with
one
of
her
hands
holding
a
peg
knocked
into
the
wall
and
her
other
hand
upon
her
bosom
and
she
was
groaning
and
reciting
verses
but
when
she
had
finished
her
recitation
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
me
and
beheld
me
whereupon
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
mine
with
her487
sleeve
and
smiling
in
my
face
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
allah
grant
thee
enjoyment
of
that
which
he
hath
given
thee
wherefore
hast
thou
not
visited
thy
beloved
this
nightâand
when
i
heard
her
words
i
kicked
her
with
my
foot
upon
her
bosom
and
she
fell
down
upon
the
raised
floor
and
there
was
a
peg
there
and
it
wounded
her
forehead
on
looking
at
her
i
saw
that
her
forehead
was
cut
open
and
her
blood
was
flowing
yet
she
was
silent
and
uttered
not
a
single
letter
but
rose
immediately
and
burned
some
tinder
of
rags
and
having
closed
with
it
the
wound
tied
a
bandage
round
her
head
and
wiped
away
the
blood
that
had
flowed
upon
the
carpet
and
it
was
as
though
this
accident
had
not
occurred
she
then
came
to
me
and
smiling
in
my
face
said
to
me
with
a
gentle
voice
by
allah
o
son
of
my
uncle
i
said
not
this
to
make
a
jest
of
thee
or
of
her
i
was
troubled
just
now
by
the
aching
of
my
head
and
with
wiping
away
the
blood
but
at
the
present
moment
the
pain
of
my
head
is
alleviated
and
that
of
my
forehead
tell
me
therefore
what
hath
happened
to
thee
this
dayâso
i
related
to
her
all
that
had
befallen
me
through
the
conduct
of
that
damsel
on
this
day
and
after
i
had
done
so
i
wept
but
she
said
to
me
rejoice
at
the
announcement
of
the
success
of
thy
desire
and
the
accomplishment
of
thy
hope
verily
this
is
a
sign
of
acceptance
for
she
absented
herself
from
thee
because
she
desireth
to
try
thee
and
to
know
whether
thou
art
patient
or
not
and
whether
thou
art
sincere
in
thy
love
of
her
or
not
to-morrow
go
to
her
and
station
thyself
at
thy
first
place
and
see
what
sign
she
will
make
to
thee
for
thy
happiness
is
near
and
thy
sorrow
is
dissipatedâand
she
proceeded
to
console
me
but
i
ceased
not
to
increase
in
anxiety
and
grief
she
then
placed
the
food
before
me
but
i
kicked
it
with
my
foot
and
the
contents
of
each
saucer
were
scattered
about
and
i
said
every
one
who
is
in
love
is
insane
and
inclineth
not
to
food
nor
findeth
pleasure
in
sleepâby
allah
o
son
of
my
uncle
exclaimed
my
cousin
azeezeh
these
are
indeed
symptoms
of
love
and
her
tears
flowed
and
she
gathered
together
the
fragments
of
the
saucers
and
wiped
up
the
food
that
was
spilt
and
sat
chatting
to
me
while
i
prayed
to
god
that
he
would
hasten
the
morning

and
when
the
morning
came
and
diffused
its
light
i
repaired
to
the
damsel
and
entered
hastily
the
by-street
where
i
seated
myself
upon
the
maááabah
before
mentioned
and
lo
the
window
was
opened
and
she
put
forth
her
head
from
it
laughing
she
then
retired
and
returned
bringing
a
mirror
and
a
bag
and
a
pot
filled
with
green488
plants
and
having
also
in
her
hand
a
lamp
and
the
first
thing
that
she
did
was
this
she
took
the
mirror
in
her
hand
and
put
it
into
the
bag
then
she
tied
it
up
and
threw
it
back
into
the
chamber
after
this
she
let
down
her
hair
over
her
face
and
put
the
lamp
upon
the
top
of
the
green
plants
for
a
moment
and
then
took
all
these
things
and
departed
with
them
and
closed
the
lattice
my
heart
was
riven
by
her
secret
signs
and
her
obscure
intimations
for
she
addressed
me
not
with
a
single
word
and
my
passion
grew
more
violent
thereat
and
my
excitement
and
distraction
increased

i
retraced
my
steps
with
weeping
eye
and
sorrowful
heart
until
i
entered
the
house
where
i
saw
my
cousin
sitting
with
her
face
to
the
wall
her
heart
was
burning
with
anxiety
and
grief
and
jealousy
but
her
affection
prevented
her
from
acquainting
me
at
all
with
the
passion
which
she
felt
on
witnessing
my
excessive
love
and
distraction
i
then
looked
at
her
again
and
saw
that
she
had
on
her
head
two
bandages
one
of
them
was
on
account
of
the
accident
that
had
happened
to
her
forehead
and
the
other
was
upon
her
eye
on
account
of
a
pain
that
she
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
violence
of
her
weeping
she
was
in
a
most
miserable
case
weeping
and
reciting
these
versesâ

wherever
thou
be
mayst
thou
be
in
safety
o
thou
who
departest
and
yet
dwellest
in
my
heart
may
god
be
near
thee
wherever
thou
goest
to
deliver
thee
from
vicissitudes
and
from
misfortunes
thou
hast
gone
and
mine
eye
is
cheerless
through
thine
absence
and
my
tears
are
flowingâo
how
abundantly
and
when
she
had
ended
her
recitation
she
looked
towards
me
and
saw
me
as
she
wept
and
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
rose
to
me
but
she
could
not
speak
from
the
excessive
love
with
which
she
was
affected
and
she
remained
for
some
time
silent
after
which
she
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
tell
me
what
thou
hast
experienced
from
her
on
this
occasion
and
i
told
her
all
that
had
happened
to
me
whereupon
she
said
to
me
be
patient
for
the
time
of
thy
union
is
come
and
thou
hast
attained
the
object
of
thy
hopes
as
to
the
sign
that
she
made
to
thee
with
the
mirror
and
her
putting
it
into
the
bag
it
is
equivalent
to
her
saying
to
thee
wait
until
the
sun
shall
have
setâand
as
to
her
letting
fall
her
hair
over
her
face
it
implieth
her
saying
to
thee
when
night
cometh
and
letteth
fall
its
black
shade
over
the
light
of
day
come
hitherâand
the
sign
that
she
made
to
thee
with
the
pot
containing
the
plants
meant
that
she
would489
say
to
thee
when
thou
comest
enter
the
garden
that
is
behind
the
by-streetâand
the
sign
which
she
made
to
thee
with
the
lamp
denoted
her
saying
to
thee
when
thou
enterest
the
garden
to
the
place
where
thou
findest
the
lighted
lamp
do
thou
repair
and
seat
thyself
beneath
it
and
there
wait
for
me
for
the
love
of
thee
destroyeth
meâbut
when
i
heard
these
words
of
my
cousin
i
cried
out
from
the
excess
of
my
passion
and
said
how
many
times
dost
thou
promise
me
and
i
go
to
her
and
attain
not
my
desire
nor
find
a
true
meaning
to
thine
interpretation
and
upon
this
my
cousin
laughed
and
replied
it
remaineth
for
thee
to
have
patience
during
the
rest
of
this
day
until
the
daylight
is
gone
and
the
night
cometh
with
its
deep
darkness
and
then
shalt
thou
enjoy
thy
union
and
the
accomplishment
of
thy
hopes
and
these
words
are
true
without
any
falsehood
she
then
drew
near
to
me
and
comforted
me
with
soft
words
but
dared
not
bring
me
any
food
fearing
that
i
should
be
angry
with
her
and
hoping
that
i
might
incline
to
her
with
favour
she
only
came
to
me
and
took
off
my
outer
clothes
after
which
she
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
sit
with
me
that
i
may
converse
with
thee
to
amuse
thee
until
the
close
of
the
day
and
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
the
night
shall
not
come
without
thy
being
in
the
company
of
thy
beloved
but
i
took
no
notice
of
her
waiting
for
the
night
and
saying
o
allah
hasten
the
coming
of
the
night
and
when
it
arrived
my
cousin
wept
violently
and
gave
me
a
grain
of
pure
musk
saying
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
put
this
grain
in
thy
mouth
and
when
thou
hast
met
thy
beloved
and
she
hath
accepted
thy
suit
recite
to
her
this
verseâ

o
ye
lovers
by
allah
inform
me
how
a
youth
should
act
when
his
love
is
intense
she
then
kissed
me
and
desired
me
to
swear
that
i
would
not
recite
this
verse
until
my
departure
from
the
damsel
and
i
replied
i
hear
and
obey

the
makad
i
went
forth
at
the
hour
of
nightfall
and
proceeded
until
i
came
to
the
garden
i
found
its
gate
open
and
entered
and
beheld
a
light
in
the
distance
so
i
advanced
towards
it
and
when
i
arrived
at
it
i
found
there
a
large
maáad20
over
which
was
constructed
a
dome
of
ivory
and
ebony
and
the
lamp
was
suspended
in
the
midst
of
the
dome
the
maáad
was
furnished
with
silken
carpets
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
and
there
was
a
great
lighted
candle
in
a
candlestick
of
gold
beneath
the
lamp
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
was
a
fountain
ornamented
with
various
designs21
by
the
side
of
this490
fountain
was
a
table
of
viands
covered
with
a
silk
napkin
near
which
was
a
large
china
bottle
full
of
wine
with
a
cup
of
crystal
adorned
with
gilding
and
by
the
side
of
all
these
things
was
a
great
tray
of
silver
covered
over
i
uncovered
it
and
beheld
in
it
a
variety
of
fruits
such
as
figs
and
pomegranates
and
grapes
and
oranges
and
citrons
of
different
kinds
together
with
various
flowers
as
roses
and
jasmine
and
myrtle
and
eglantine
and
narcissus
and
all
kinds
of
sweet
scents
i
was
astonished
at
this
place
and
affected
with
the
utmost
delight
and
my
anxiety
and
grief
were
dissipated
but
i
found
not
in
this
abode
any
being
of
the
creatures
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
not
even
a
male
or
female
slave
did
i
see
nor
the
person
who
thus
neglected
these
things
i
sat
in
this
chamber
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
beloved
of
my
heart
until
the
first
hour
of
the
night
had
passed
and
the
second
hour
and
the
third
but
she
came
not
and
hunger
began
to
torment
me
violently
for
a
long
time
had
elapsed
without
my
eating
food
through
the
excess
of
my
passion491
but
when
i
beheld
this
place
and
my
cousins
correct
understanding
of
the
signs
made
by
my
beloved
became
manifest
to
me
i
felt
at
ease
yet
i
still
experienced
the
torment
of
hunger
and
the
savoury
odours
of
the
food
upon
the
table
had
excited
my
desire
on
my
arrival
there
feeling
secure
therefore
of
the
attainment
of
my
object
and
longing
to
eat
i
approached
the
table
and
took
off
the
cover
and
found
in
the
midst
of
it
a
dish
of
china
containing
four
fricandoed
fowls
seasoned
with
spices
around
which
were
four
saucers
one
containing
sweetmeats
and
another
conserve
of
pomegranate-grains
and
a
third
baálÃweh22
and
the
fourth
áaáÃÃf23
the
contents
of
these
saucers
consisting
both
of
sweet
and
acid
so
i
ate
of
the
áaáÃÃf
and
a
piece
of
meat
and
i
put
my
hand
to
the
baálÃweh
and
ate
of
it
as
much
as
was
agreeable
and
then
turned
to
the
sweetmeat
and
ate
a
spoonful
or
two
or
three
or
four
and
i
ate
a
portion
of
a
fowl
and
a
morsel
of
another
dish
and
when
i
had
done
this
my
stomach
was
full
and
my
joints
became
loose
and
i
was
too
lazy
to
remain
awake
so
i
laid
my
head
upon
a
cushion
after
i
had
washed
my
hands
and
sleep
overcame
me
and
i
knew
not
what
happened
to
me
after
this
i
awoke
not
until
the
sun
scorched
me
for
some
days
had
passed
without
my
having
tasted
sleep
and
when
i
awoke
i
found
upon
my
stomach
some
salt
and
charcoal
and
i
stood
up
and
shook
my
clothes
and
looked
to
the
right
and
left
but
found
no
one
i
discovered
that
i
had
been
sleeping
upon
the
marble
pavement
without
anything
spread
beneath
me
and
i
was
perplexed
in
my
mind
and
mourned
greatly
my
tears
ran
down
upon
my
cheeks
and
i
lamented
for
myself

i
then
returned
to
the
house
and
when
i
arrived
there
i
found
my
cousin
striking
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
and
weeping
with
tears
like
raining
clouds
but
when
she
beheld
me
she
arose
quickly
and
wiped
away
her
tears
and
addressing
me
with
her
soft
speech
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
god
hath
been
gracious
to
thee
in
thy
passion
since
the
person
whom
thou
lovest
loveth
thee
while
i
remain
weeping
and
mourning
for
the
separation
of
thee
who
findest
fault
with
me
but
may
god
not
chastise
thee
on
my
account
she
then
smiled
in
my
face
with
the
smile
of
one
in
anger
and
caressed
me
and
took
off
my
outer
clothes
and
spread
them
out
and
said
by
allah
these
are
not
the
odours
of
one
who
hath
enjoyed
the
company
of
his
beloved
tell
me
then
what
hath
happened
to
thee
o
son
of
my
uncleâand
i
told
her
all
that
had
befallen
me
whereupon
she
smiled
a
second
time
with
the
smile
of
one
in
anger492
and
said
verily
my
heart
is
full
and
in
pain
but
may
the
person
who
paineth
thy
heart
cease
to
exist
this
woman
maketh
herself
extravagantly
difficult
to
thee
by
allah
o
son
of
my
uncle
i
fear
what
she
may
do
to
thee
know
that
the
meaning
of
the
salt
is
thou
art
drowned
in
sleep
and
seemest
insipid
so
that
the
soul
regardeth
thee
with
loathing
and
thou
requirest
to
be
salted
that
the
stomach
may
not
eject
thee
thou
pretendest
that
thou
art
of
the
number
of
generous
lovers
but
sleep
unto
lovers
is
forbidden
and
thy
pretension
to
love
is
falseâsuch
however
is
her
pretension
her
love
for
thee
is
false
for
when
she
saw
thee
sleeping
she
did
not
rouse
thee
and
had
her
love
for
thee
been
true
she
would
have
roused
theeâand
as
to
the
charcoal
the
meaning
indicated
by
it
is
may
god
blacken
thy
face24
since
thou
hast
made
false
pretensions
to
love
when
thou
art
only
a
child
and
hast
no
care
but
for
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
this
is
the
interpretation
of
her
sign
and
may
allah
whose
name
be
exalted
deliver
thee
from
herânow
when
i
heard
what
she
said
i
struck
my
hand
upon
my
breast
and
exclaimed
by
allah
this
is
the
truth
for
i
slept
and
lovers
sleep
not
so
i
have
wronged
mine
own
self
what
could
have
been
more
injurious
to
me
than
eating
and
sleeping
and
what
is
to
be
doneâi
then
wept
exceedingly
and
said
to
my
cousin
direct
me
what
to
do
and
have
mercy
upon
me
so
may
god
have
mercy
upon
thee
otherwise
i
shall
die
my
cousin
therefore
having
a
very
great
love
for
me
replied
on
my
head
and
my
eye
but
o
son
of
my
uncle
i
have
told
thee
several
times
that
if
i
had
the
privilege
of
coming
in
and
going
out
when
i
pleased
i
would
accomplish
thy
union
with
her
in
the
shortest
time
and
cover
you
both
with
my
skirt
and
this
i
would
not
do
but
from
the
desire
of
obtaining
thine
approval
if
god
permit
i
will
employ
my
utmost
endeavours
to
bring
you
together
but
hear
my
words
and
comply
with
my
directions
and
go
to
that
same
place
and
seat
thyself
there
when
the
hour
of
nightfall
is
come
seat
thyself
in
the
place
where
thou
wast
and
beware
of
eating
anything
for
eating
induceth
sleep
have
a
care
then
that
thou
sleep
not
for
she
will
not
come
to
thee
until
a
quarter
of
the
night
hath
passed
and
may
god
avert
from
thee
her
wickednessâso
when
i
heard
her
words
i
rejoiced
and
prayed
god
to
hasten
the
night
and
when
night
came
i
desired
to
depart
and
my
cousin
said
to
me
when
thou
hast
met
her
repeat
to
her
the
verse
before
mentioned
at
the
time
of
thy
departure
i
replied
on
the
head
and
the
eye493

and
when
i
went
forth
and
repaired
to
the
garden
i
found
the
place
prepared
in
the
same
state
in
which
i
had
seen
it
before
in
it
was
everything
requisite
of
food
and
drink
and
dried
fruits
and
sweet
scents
and
other
things
and
i
went
up
into
the
maáad
and
smelling
the
odour
of
the
food
i
longed
for
it
i
refrained
from
it
several
times
but
at
length
i
could
not
withstand
it
so
i
arose
and
went
to
the
table
and
took
off
its
cover
and
found
a
dish
of
fowls
around
which
were
four
saucers
of
food
of
four
different
kinds
and
i
ate
of
each
kind
a
morsel
and
as
much
as
was
agreeable
of
the
sweetmeat
and
a
piece
of
meat
and
drank
some
zardeh25
and
finding
it
pleasant
to
me
i
drank
again
of
it
plentifully
by
the
spoonful
until
i
was
satiated
and
my
stomach
was
full
and
after
this
my
eyelids
closed
so
i
took
a
pillow
and
put
it
beneath
my
head
saying
perhaps
i
may
recline
upon
it
without
sleeping
but
i
closed
my
eyes
and
slept
and
awoke
not
until
the
sun
had
risen
when
i
found
upon
my
stomach
a
play-bone
and
a
áÃb-stick26
and
a
date-stone
and
a
locust-seed
and
there
was
no
furniture
nor
anything
else
in
the
place
and
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
had
been
there
on
the
preceding
night

i
rose
and
shook
off
all
these
things
from
me
and
went
forth
enraged
and
arriving
at
the
house
i
found
my
cousin
groaning
and
i
chid
her
and
abused
her
whereupon
she
wept
and
having
wiped
away
her
tears
approached
and
kissed
me
and
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
but
i
drew
back
from
her
blaming
myself
she
then
said
to
me
o
son
of
my
uncle
it
seemeth
that
thou
hast
slept
again
this
last
night
i
replied
yes
and
when
i
awoke
i
found
a
play-bone
laid
upon
my
stomach
and
a
áÃb-stick
and
a
date-stone
and
a
locust-seed
and
i
know
not
wherefore
she
did
this
then
i
wept
and
approached
her
and
said
to
her
explain
to
me
the
meaning
of
her
doing
this
and
tell
me
how
i
shall
act
and
assist
me
in
my
trouble
she
replied
on
the
head
and
the
eye
as
to
the
áÃb-stick
and
the
play-bone
which
she
placed
upon
thy
stomach
she
meaneth
thereby
that
thou
camest
there
and
thy
heart
was
absent
as
though
she
would
say
to
thee
love
is
not
thus
therefore
reckon
not
thyself
among
lovers27
and
as
to
the
date-stone
she
indicated
by
it
that
if
thou
wert
a
lover
thy
heart
had
been
burning
with
passion
and
thou
wouldst
not
taste
the
delight
of
sleep
for
the
sweetness
of
love
is
like
a
date
which
kindleth
a
fire
in
the
heart28
and
as
to
the
locust-seed
she
intimated
to
thee
by
it
that
the
heart
of
the
lover
is
fatigued
and
she
would
say
to
thee
thereby
endure494
our
separation
with
the
patience
of
job29âwhen
i
heard
this
interpretation
fire
darted
into
my
heart
and
my
grief
increased
and
i
cried
out
and
exclaimed
god
had
decreed
that
i
should
sleep
on
account
of
my
little
fortune
i
then
said
to
her
o
daughter
of
my
uncle
by
my
life
i
conjure
thee
to
contrive
for
me
some
stratagem
by
means
of
which
i
may
obtain
an
interview
with
her
and
i
weptâo
azeez
o
son
of
my
uncle
she
replied
verily
my
heart
is
full
of
thoughts
and
i
cannot
talk
but
go
thou
to-night
to
that
place
and
beware
of
sleeping
and
so
shalt
thou
attain
thy
desire
this
is
my
counsel
and
peace
be
on
theeâi
said
if
it
please
god
i
will
not
sleep
but
i
will
do
as
thou
chargest
me
and
my
cousin
arose
and
brought
me
food
saying
to
me
eat
now
what
will
satisfy
thee
that
thou
mayest
have
no
desire
remaining
so
i
ate
what
satisfied
me
and
when
night
came
my
cousin
arose
and
brought
me
a
superb
suit
of
clothing
and
clad
me
with
it
and
conjured
me
to
repeat
to
the
damsel
the
verse
before
mentioned
and
cautioned
me
against
sleeping

i
then
departed
from
her
and
having
repaired
to
the
garden
went
up
into
the
maáad
and
i
gazed
at
the
garden
and
kept
opening
my
eyes
with
my
fingers
and
shaking
my
head
as
the
night
grew
dark
but
i
became
hungry
from
watching
and
the
odours
of
the
food
were
wafted
towards
me
and
my
hunger
in
consequence
increased
so
i
went
to
the
table
and
removed
its
cover
and
ate
a
morsel
of
every
dish
and
a
piece
of
meat
and
i
went
to
the
bottle
of
wine
saying
within
myself
i
will
drink
a
cupâand
i
drank
it
and
then
drank
the
second
and
the
third
and
so
on
to
the
number
of
ten
and
being
already
stricken
by
love
i
fell
upon
the
floor
as
one
slain
thus
i
remained
until
day
came
and
i
awoke
and
found
myself
outside
the
garden
with
a
large
sharp
knife
upon
my
stomach
and
an
iron
dirhem30
and
i
trembled
with
fear
and
took
them
with
me
and
returned
to
the
house

azeez
returned
with
the
knife
and
dirhem
i
found
my
cousin
saying
i
am
in
this
house
wretched
and
sorrowful
with
no
relief
but
weeping
and
as
i
entered
i
fell
down
prostrate
throwing
the
knife
and
dirhem
from
my
hand
and
fainted
and
when
i
recovered
i
acquainted
her
with
that
which
had
befallen
me
and
said
to
her
i
shall
not
attain
my
desire
her
grief
increased
at
witnessing
my
weeping
and
my
excessive
passion
and
she
said
to
me
i
have
failed
of
success
in
cautioning
thee
against
sleeping
for
thou
wouldst
not
attend
to
my
advice
my
words
profit
thee
nothing
but
i
replied
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou495
explain
to
me
the
meaning
of
the
knife
and
the
iron
dirhem
so
she
said
as
to
the
dirhem
she
alluded
by
it
to
her
right
eye31
and
intimated
that
she
swore
by
it
and
said
by
the
lord
of
all
creatures
and
by
my
right
eye32
if
thou
come
again
and
sleep
i
will
assuredly
slaughter
thee
with
this
knifeâi
fear
for
thee
therefore
o
son
of
my
uncle
from
her
malice
and
my
heart
is
full
of
grief
on
thine
account
and
i
cannot
talk
if
then
thou
art
confident
in
thyself
that
if
thou
return
to
her
thou
wilt
not
sleep
return
to
her
and
beware
of
sleeping
and
so
shalt
thou
attain
thy
desire
but
if
thou
know
that
shouldst
thou
go
to
her
again
thou
wilt
sleep
as
usual
and
so
go
to
her
and
sleep
she
will
slaughter
theeâwhat
then
said
i
is
to
be
done
o
daughter
of
my
uncle
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
to
help
me
in
this
afflictionâshe
replied
on
my
head
and
my
eye
and
if
thou
attend
to
my
words
and
comply
with
my
directions
thou
wilt
accomplish
thy
desire
i
said
i
will
do
so
and
she
rejoined
when
the
time
of
departure
cometh
i
will
tell
thee
she
then
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
and
laid
me
on
the
bed
and
continued
gently
kneading
my
limbs
until
slumber
overcame
me
and
i
sank
into
sleep33
and
she
took
a
fan
and
seating
herself
at
my
head
fanned
my
face
until
the
close
of
day
when
she
roused
me
and
on
my
awaking
i
found
her
at
my
head
with
the
fan
in
her
hand
and
weeping
so
that
her
tears
had
wetted
her
clothes
but496
when
she
saw
me
that
i
had
awoke
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
brought
me
some
food
i
refrained
from
it
but
she
said
to
me
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
thou
must
attend
to
my
directions
eat
thereforeâso
i
ate
and
would
not
oppose
her
and
she
proceeded
to
put
the
food
into
my
mouth
while
i
chewed
it
until
my
stomach
was
full
she
then
gave
me
to
drink
some
infusion
of
jujubes34
with
sugar
and
washed
my
hands
and
dried
them
with
a
handkerchief
and
sprinkled
some
rose-water
upon
me
after
which
i
sat
with
her
in
healthy
frame
and
when
the
night
became
dark
she
put
on
me
my
clothes
and
said
o
son
of
my
uncle
watch
all
night
and
sleep
not
for
she
will
not
come
to
thee
this
night
until
near
its
close
and
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
thou
shalt
meet
her
this
night
but
forget
not
my
charge
then
she
wept
and
my
heart
was
pained
for
her
on
account
of
her
excessive
weeping
and
i
said
to
her
what
is
the
charge
which
thou
gavest
me
she
answered
when
thou
departest
from
her
repeat
to
her
the
verse
before
mentioned

i
then
went
forth
from
her
full
of
joy
and
proceeded
to
the
garden
and
went
up
to
the
maáad
satiated
with
food
i
remained
sleepless
a
quarter
of
the
night
and
the
night
seemed
as
long
to
me
as
though
it
were
a
year
and
i
continued
watching
until
two
thirds
of
it
had
passed
and
the
cocks
crew
and
i
became
violently
hungry
from
watching
so
i
went
up
to
the
table
and
ate
until
i
was
satisfied
and
my
head
became
heavy
and
i
desired
to
sleep
but
suddenly
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
distance
whereupon
i
arose
and
washed
my
hands
and
mouth
and
roused
myself
and
soon
after
she
came
she
was
accompanied
by
ten
female
slaves
and
she
appeared
among
them
like
the
full
moon
among
the
planets
she
was
attired
in
a
garment
of
green
satin
embroidered
with
red
gold
and
when
she
saw
me
she
laughed
and
said
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
remained
awake
and
that
sleep
hath
not
overcome
thee
now
that
thou
hast
passed
the
night
sleepless
i
am
convinced
that
thou
art
a
lover
for
among
the
characteristics
of
lovers
is
the
watching
by
night
in
the
resolute
endurance
of
desireâshe
then
turned
towards
her
female
slaves
and
made
a
sign
to
them
whereupon
they
departed
from
her
and
she
approached
me
and
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
and
kissed
me
and
we
conversed
together
until
the
morning
when
i
desired
to
depart
but
she
held
me
and
said
to
me
stop
that
i
may
acquaint
thee
with
something
and
give
thee
a
chargeâso
i
stopped
and
she
unfolded
a
handkerchief
and
taking
forth
from
it
this
piece
of
linen
spread
it
open
before497
me
and
i
found
in
it
the
design
of
the
gazelles
as
thou
seest
and
i
admired
it
exceedingly
and
took
it
after
which
i
made
a
promise
to
her
that
i
would
pay
her
a
visit
every
night
in
that
garden
and
departed
from
her
full
of
joy
but
in
my
joy
i
forgot
the
verse
which
my
cousin
had
charged
me
to
repeat
and
when
she
gave
me
the
piece
of
linen
containing
the
design
of
the
gazelles
she
said
to
me
this
is
the
work
of
my
sisterâand
what
said
i
is
the
name
of
thy
sister
she
answered
her
name
is
noor-el-hudÃ
35
and
do
thou
take
care
of
this
piece
of
linen

azeezeh
weeping
over
the
design
of
the
gazelles
after
this
when
i
had
taken
leave
of
her
and
departed
full
of
joy
i
returned
and
went
in
to
my
cousin
and
found
her
lying
down
and
when
she
saw
me
she
rose
her
tears
dropping
and
approached
me
and
kissing
my
bosom
said
hast
thou
recited
the
verse
as
i
charged
thee
i
answered
i
forgot
it
and
nothing
drove
it
from
my
mind
but
the
design
of
these
gazelles
and
i
threw
down
the
piece
of
linen
before
her
she
arose
and
then
seated
herself
again
and
in
her
impatience
shed
tears
and
said
o
son
of
my
uncle
make
a
present
to
me
of
this
piece
of
linen
so
i
gave
it
her
and
she
took
it
and
spread
it
open
and
saw
what
was
in
it
and
when
the
time
of
my
departure
came
she
said
go
and
may
safety
attend
thee
but
when
thou
retirest
from
her
recite
to
her
the
verse
that
i
taught
thee
before
and
which
thou
didst
forgetârepeat
it
to
me
said
i
and
she
did
so

i
then
repaired
to
the
garden
and
entered
the
maáad
i
found
the
damsel
waiting
for
me
and
when
she
beheld
me
she
arose
and
kissed
me
and
seated
me
and
we
ate
and
drank
and
in
the
morning
i
repeated
to
her
the
verse
which
was
thisâ

o
ye
lovers
by
allah
inform
me
how
a
youth
should
act
when
his
love
is
intense
498and
when
she
heard
it
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thus
she
repliedâ

he
should
hide
his
love
and
conceal
his
secret
and
be
patient
under
every
event
and
submissive
i
committed
this
to
memory
and
glad
at
having
done
what
my
cousin
desired
went
forth
and
returned
to
her
i
found
her
lying
down
with
my
mother
at
her
head
weeping
for
her
unhappy
state
and
when
i
went
in
to
her
my
mother
said
to
me
perdition
to
such
a
cousin
as
thou
how
canst
thou
leave
the
daughter
of
thine
uncle
indisposed
and
not
inquire
respecting
her
diseaseâbut
my
cousin
on
beholding
me
raised
her
head
and
sat
up
and
said
to
me
o
azeez
hast
thou
repeated
to
her
the
verse
that
i
taught
thee
i
answered
yes
and
when
she
heard
it
she
wept
and
recited
to
me
another
verse
which
i
retain
in
my
memoryâlet
me
hear
it
said
my
cousin
and
when
i
had
repeated
it
to
her
she
wept
violently
and
recited
this
other
verseâ

he
hath
sought
to
attain
a
becoming
patience
but
found
nought
save
a
heart
pining
with
desire
she
then
said
to
me
when
thou
goest
to
her
as
usual
repeat
to
her
this
verse
which
thou
hast
heard
i
replied
i
hear
and
obey

so
i
went
to
the
garden
according
to
my
custom
and
when
i
was
about
to
return
i
recited
to
the
damsel
that
verse
and
when
she
heard
it
tears
poured
from
her
eyes
and
she
repliedâ

then
if
he
have
not
patience
to
conceal
his
secret
i
know
nothing
better
for
him
than
death
retaining
this
in
my
memory
i
returned
to
the
house
and
when
i
went
in
to
my
cousin
i
found
her
fallen
down
in
a
fit
and
my
mother
sitting
at
her
head
and
when
my
cousin
heard
my
voice
she
opened
her
eyes
and
said
o
azeez
hast
thou
repeated
to
her
the
verse
i
answered
yes
and
when
she
heard
it
she
wept
and
recited
to
me
this
other
verse
and
i
repeated
it
to
her
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
it
she
fainted
again
and
on
her
recovering
recited
another
verse
which
was
thisâ

we
hear
and
obey
and
we
die
then
convey
my
salutation
to
the
person
who
hath
prevented
our
union36
at
the
approach
of
the
following
night
i
went
again
to
the
garden
as
usual
and
found
the
damsel
expecting
me
and
we
ate
and
drank
and
in
the
morning
when
i
was
about
to
depart
i
repeated499
to
her
what
my
cousin
had
said
whereupon
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
was
agitated
and
exclaimed
by
allah
she
who
uttered
this
verse
hath
died
she
then
wept
and
said
to
me
wo
to
thee
is
not
she
who
uttered
this
verse
related
to
theeâi
answered
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
paternal
uncleâthou
liest
replied
she
by
allah
if
she
were
the
daughter
of
thy
uncle
thou
hadst
borne
her
the
same
love
that
she
bore
thee
thou
art
he
who
hath
destroyed
her
and
may
god
destroy
thee
in
like
manner
by
allah
if
thou
hadst
told
me
of
thy
having
a
cousin
i
had
not
admitted
thee
into
my
favourâverily
said
i
she
is
my
cousin
and
she
explained
to
me
the
signs
that
thou
madest
me
and
it
was
she
who
taught
me
how
to
proceed
with
thee
i
had
not
obtained
access
to
thee
but
through
her
good
managementâand
did
she
know
of
our
affair
said
she
i
answered
yesâmay
allah
she
exclaimed
cause
thee
to
bewail
thy
youth
as
thou
hast
caused
her
to
bewail
hers
she
then
said
to
me
go
and
see
her

azeezeh
dead
i
departed
therefore
troubled
in
mind
and
proceeded
until
i
came
to
our
street
when
i
heard
a
wailing
and
asking
respecting
it
was
answered
we
found
azeezeh
lying
behind
the
door
dead
i
entered
the
house
and
when
my
mother
beheld
me
she
exclaimed
the
crime
of
destroying
her
is
on
thy
neck
and
may
god
not
pardon
thee
her
blood
perdition
to
such
a
cousin
as
thouâmy
father
then
came
and
we
prepared
her
body
for
interment
and
performed
the
funeral-ceremonies
and
buried
her
and
we
caused
recitations
of
the
whole
of
the
áur-Ãn
to
be
performed
at
her
tomb
and
remained
there
three
days
after
which
i
returned
to
the
house
sorrowing
for
her
and
my
mother
addressed
me
and
said
i
desire
to
know
what
thou
didst
to
her
so
that
thou
brokest
her
heart
i
asked
her
continually
o
my
son
respecting
the
cause
of
her
disorder
but
she
would
not
acquaint
me
with
it
i
conjure
thee
therefore
by
allah
that
thou
inform
me
what
thou
didst
unto
her500
to
cause
her
deathâi
replied
i
did
nothing
but
she
said
may
god
avenge
her
upon
thee
for
she
mentioned
to
me
nothing
but
concealed
the
truth
of
her
case
until
she
died
still
preserving
her
affection
for
thee
and
when
she
died
i
was
with
her
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
said
to
me
o
wife
of
my
uncle
may
god
hold
thy
son
guiltless
of
my
blood
and
not
punish
him
for
that
which
he
hath
done
unto
me
and
now
god
transporteth
me
from
the
perishable
world
to
the
world
of
eternity
and
i
replied
o
my
daughter
may
god
preserve
thee
and
preserve
thy
youth
and
i
asked
her
respecting
the
cause
of
her
disorder
but
she
answered
not
then
she
smiled
and
said
o
wife
of
my
uncle
if
thy
son
desire
to
go
to
the
place
which
he
is
accustomed
to
frequent
tell
him
to
repeat
these
two
phrases
on
departing
from
itâfidelity
is
good
and
treachery
is
baseâand
this
i
desire
in
my
compassion
for
him
that
i
may
shew
him
compassion
in
my
life
and
after
my
death
she
then
gave
me
something
for
thee
and
took
an
oath
of
me
that
i
would
not
give
it
to
thee
until
i
should
see
thee
weeping
for
her
and
lamenting
this
thing
i
have
and
when
i
see
thee
in
the
state
that
she
hath
described
i
will
give
it
to
theeâi
said
to
her
shew
it
me
but
she
would
not

i
then
gave
myself
up
to
my
pleasures
and
thought
not
of
the
death
of
my
cousin
for
i
was
unsettled
in
mind
and
wished
that
i
were
passing
the
whole
of
every
night
and
day
with
my
beloved
and
scarcely
had
the
next
night
approached
when
i
repaired
again
to
the
garden
i
found
the
damsel
sitting
there
burning
with
impatience
to
see
me
and
as
soon
as
she
beheld
me
she
hastened
to
me
and
clung
to
my
neck
and
asked
me
respecting
my
cousin
i
answered
her
she
is
dead
and
we
have
performed
zikrs37
and
recitations
of
the
áur-Ãn
for
her
and
four
nights
have
passed
since
her
death
and
this
is
the
fifth
when
she
heard
this
she
cried
out
and
wept
and
said
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
thou
hadst
killed
her
hadst
thou
informed
me
of
her
before
her
death
i
had
requited
her
for
the
kindness
that
she
hath
shewn
me
for
she
hath
been
of
service
to
me
in
giving
thee
access
to
me
had
it
not
been
for
her
i
should
not
have
had
an
interview
with
thee
and
i
fear
thou
wilt
fall
into
a
calamity
on
account
of
her
disasterâi
replied
she
acquitted
me
before
her
death
and
i
related
to
her
what
my
mother
had
told
me
upon
which
she
exclaimed
by
allah
i
conjure
thee
when
thou
goest
to
thy
mother
learn
what
it
is
that
she
hathâmy
mother
said
i
told
me
thy
cousin
before
she
died
charged501
me
saying
if
thy
son
desire
to
go
to
the
place
which
he
is
accustomed
to
frequent
tell
him
to
repeat
these
two
phrasesâfidelity
is
good
and
treachery
is
baseâand
when
the
damsel
heard
this
she
exclaimed
the
mercy
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
be
upon
her
for
she
hath
saved
thee
from
me
i
was
meditating
an
injury
to
thee
but
now
i
will
not
hurt
thee
nor
trouble
thee
and
i
wondered
at
this
and
said
to
her
what
didst
thou
purpose
before
this
to
do
to
me
after
mutual
love
had
taken
place
between
us
she
answered
thou
art
devoted
to
me
but
thou
art
young
and
thy
mind
is
free
from
deceit
and
thou
knowest
not
our
malice
nor
our
deceit
were
she
still
in
the
bonds
of
life
she
would
assist
thee
for
she
is
the
cause
of
thy
safety
and
hath
delivered
thee
from
destruction
and
now
i
charge
thee
that
thou
speak
not
with
any
female
nor
answer
any
of
our
sex
young
or
old
beware
beware
for
thou
art
ignorant
of
the
deceit
of
women
and
their
malice
she
who
used
to
interpret
the
signs
to
thee
is
dead
and
i
fear
for
thee
lest
thou
fall
into
a
calamity
and
find
none
to
deliver
thee
from
it
after
the
death
of
thy
cousin
o
my
sorrow
for
the
daughter
of
thy
uncle
would
that
i
had
known
her
before
her
death
that
i
might
have
requited
her
for
the
kindness
that
she
hath
done
me
the
mercy
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
be
upon
her
for
she
concealed
her
secret
and
revealed
not
what
she
felt
and
but
for
her
thou
wouldst
never
have
had
access
to
me
and
now
i
have
a
service
to
demand
of
theeâwhat
is
it
said
i
she
answered
that
thou
conduct
me
to
her
tomb
that
i
may
visit
her
at
her
grave
and
inscribe
some
verses
upon
it
i
replied
to-morrow
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exaltedâso
i
remained
with
her
that
night
and
frequently
she
said
to
me
would
that
thou
hadst
told
me
of
thy
cousin
before
her
death
and
i
asked
her
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
which
she
saidâfidelity
is
good
and
treachery
is
base
but
she
answered
me
not

azeez
and
his
mistress
at
the
grave
of
azeezeh
in
the
morning
therefore
she
arose
and
taking
a
purse
containing
some
pieces
of
gold
said
to
me
arise
and
shew
me
the
tomb
that
i
may
visit
it
and
write
upon
it
some
verses
and
build
over
it
a
cupola
and
pray
for
mercy
upon
her
and
bestow
these
pieces
of
gold
in
alms
for
her
soul
i
replied
i
hear
and
obey
and
i
walked
before
her
and
she
followed
me
and
employed
herself
in
giving
alms
on
the
way
as
she
went
and
every
time
that
she
did
so
she
said
this
is
an
alms
for
the
soul
of
azeezeh
who
concealed
her
secret
until
she
drank
the
cup
of
death
and
revealed502
not
her
love
thus
she
continued
to
give
of
the
contents
of
the
purse
and
to
say
for
the
soul
of
azeezehâuntil
we
arrived
at
the
tomb
and
the
contents
of
the
purse
were
exhausted
and
when
she
beheld
the
tomb
she
threw
herself
upon
it
and
wept
violently
she
then
took
forth
a
pointed
instrument
of
steel
and
a
small
mallet
and
engraved
upon
the
stone
at
the
head
of
the
tomb
in
small
characters
these
versesâ

i
passed
by
an
undistinguished
tomb
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
with
seven
anemones
upon
it38
and
i
said
whose
tomb
is
this
the
soil
answered
be
respectful
for
this
is
the
resting-place
of
a
lover
so
i
said
god
keep
thee
o
victim
of
love
and
lodge
thee
in
the
highest
stage
of
paradise
how
miserable
are
lovers
among
the
creation
when
even
their
tombs
are
covered
with
vile
dust
were
i
able
o
tomb
i
would
make
of
thee
a
garden
and
water
it
with
my
streaming
tears
503
she
then
again
wept
violently
and
arose
and
i
arose
with
her
and
after
we
had
returned
to
the
garden
she
said
to
me
i
conjure
thee
by
allah
that
thou
never
forsake
me
and
i
replied
i
hear
and
obey
so
i
resumed
my
visits
to
her
as
before
and
she
treated
me
with
kindness
and
honour
and
used
to
ask
me
respecting
the
two
phrases
which
my
cousin
azeezeh
had
mentioned
to
my
mother
and
i
repeated
them
to
her
thus
i
remained
eating
and
drinking
and
enjoying
her
conversation
and
attiring
myself
in
changes
of
delicate
clothing
until
i
became
stout
and
fat
and
i
experienced
neither
anxiety
nor
grief
nor
sorrow
and
forgot
my
cousin

i
continued
drowned
in
these
pleasures
for
a
whole
year
and
at
the
commencement
of
the
new
year
i
entered
the
bath
and
refreshed
myself
and
put
on
a
handsome
suit
and
after
i
had
gone
forth
from
the
bath
i
drank
a
cup
of
wine
and
smelt
the
odours
of
my
clothes
which
were
richly
perfumed
with
various
scents
my
heart
was
unoppressed
by
calamities
or
misfortunes
and
when
the
hour
of
nightfall
came
i
desired
to
repair
to
the
damsel
but
i
was
intoxicated
and
knew
not
my
way
and
in
going
to
her
intoxication
led
me
aside
into
a
by-street
called
the
street
of
the
naáeeb39
and
as
i
was
proceeding
along
it
lo
an
old
woman
came
with
a
lighted
candle
in
one
of
her
hands
and
in
her
other
hand
a
folded
letter
i
advanced
towards
her
and
she
with
weeping
eye
said
to
me
o
my
son
art
thou
able
to
read
i
answered
her
yes
my
old
aunt
and
she
said
take
this
letter
and
read
it
to
me
and
she
handed
me
the
letter
so
i
took
it
from
her
and
opened
it
and
read
to
her
its
contents
informing
her
that
it
was
a
letter
from
the
absent
with
salutations
to
the
beloved
and
when
she
heard
this
she
rejoiced
at
the
good
news
and
ejaculated
a
prayer
for
me
saying
may
god
dispel
thine
anxiety
as
thou
hast
dispelled
mine
she
then
took
the
letter
and
proceeded
a
few
steps
but
presently
she
returned
to
me
and
kissing
my
hand
said
o
my
lord
may
god
whose
name
be
exalted
give
thee
enjoyment
of
thy
youth
and
not
disgrace
thee
i
beg
that
thou
wilt
walk
with
me
a
few
paces
to
that
door
for
i
have
told
them
what
thou
hast
read
to
me
of
the
letter
and
they
do
not
believe
me
come
with
me
therefore
two
steps
and
read
to
them
the
letter
outside
the
door
and
accept
my
prayer
for
theeâand
what
said
i
is
the
history
of
this
letter
she
answered
o
my
son
this
letter
hath
come
from
my
son
who
hath
been
absent
from
us
for
the
space
of
ten
years
for
he
journeyed
with
merchandise
and
hath
remained504
abroad
during
that
period
and
we
relinquished
all
hope
of
his
return
thinking
that
he
was
dead
then
came
to
us
this
letter
from
him
and
he
hath
a
sister
who
hath
wept
for
him
during
his
absence
night
and
day
and
i
told
her
that
he
was
in
health
and
prosperity
but
she
believed
me
not
and
said
to
me
thou
must
bring
me
a
person
to
read
this
letter
and
to
acquaint
me
with
its
contents
that
my
heart
may
be
set
at
ease
and
my
mind
comfortedâthou
knowest
o
my
son
that
the
loving
is
prepossessed
with
evil
anticipations

me
therefore
by
reading
this
letter
while
thou
shalt
stand
outside
the
curtain
and
his
sister
shall
hear
it
within
the
door
that
the
recompense
of
him
who
accomplisheth
a
want
for
a
muslim
and
dispelleth
from
his
mind
a
trouble
may
be
thine
for

apostle
of
god

sorrowful
person

of
the
troubles
of
this
world

dispel
from
his
mind
one
of
the
troubles
of
the
world

in
another
tradition
whoso

from
the
mind
of

of

his
mind
seventy-two
of
the
troubles
of

day
of

now
i
have
desired
thee

not
disappoint
meâso
i
replied
i
hear
and
obey
proceed
before
me

she
therefore
walked
before
me
and
i
followed
her
a
little
way
until
she
arrived
at
a
great
door
overlaid
with
copper
and
she
stopped
at
this
door
and
called
out
in
persian
and
immediately
a
damsel
approached
with
light
and
nimble
step
her
trousers
were
tucked
up
to
her
knees
and
i
beheld
a
pair
of
legs
that
confounded
the
mind
and
the
eye
by
their
beauty
they
were
like
two
columns
of
alabaster
and
ornamented
with
anklets
of
gold
set
with
jewels
the
skirts
of
her
outer
clothes
were
tucked
up
under
her
arms
and
her
sleeves
were
turned
up
from
her
arms
and
i
looked
at
her
white
wrists
and
upon
them
were
two
pairs
of
bracelets
in
her
ears
were
two
ear-rings
of
pearls
and
upon
her
neck
was
a
necklace
of
costly
jewels
and
on
her
head
a
koofeeyeh40
quite
new
adorned
with
precious
gems
she
had
tucked
the
skirt
of
her
inner
tunic
within
the
band
of
her
trousers
and
appeared
as
though
she
had
been
employed
in
some
active
work
and
when
she
beheld
me
she
said
with
an
eloquent
and
sweet
tongue
that
i
had
never
heard
surpassed
in
sweetness
o
my
mother
is
this
he
who
hath
come
to
read
the
letter
she
answered
yes
and
the
damsel
stretched
forth
her
hand
to
me
with
the
letter
there
was
between
her
and
the
door
a
distance
of
about
half
a
rod41
and
i505
extended
my
hand
to
take
the
letter
from
her
and
put
my
head
and
shoulders
within
the
door
to
draw
near
to
her
but
before
i
knew
what
she
was
about
to
do
the
old
woman
placed
her
head
against
my
back
and
pushed
me
forward
while
my
hand
was
holding
the
letter
and
i
looked
around
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
house
that
is
within
the
vestibule
the
old
woman
entered
more
quickly
than
the
blinding
lightning
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
shut
the
door
and
when
the
damsel
beheld
me
within
the
vestibule
she
approached
me
and
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
unable
to
extricate
myself
from
her
grasp
led
me
preceded
by
the
old
woman
with
the
lighted
candle
until
she
had
passed
through
seven
vestibules
after
which
she
conducted
me
into
a
large
saloon
with
four
leewÃns42
in
which
a
horseman
might
play
at
goff43
she
then
seated
me
and
said
to
me
open
thine
eye
and
i
did
so
giddy
from
the
violence
that
i
had
experienced
and
saw
that
the
whole
construction
of
the
saloon
was
of
the
most
beautiful
alabaster
and
all
its
furniture
including
the
cushions
and
mattresses
of
brocade
in
it
were
also
two
benches
of
brass
and
a
couch
of
red
gold
set
with
pearls
and
jewels
not
suitable
to
any
but
a
king
like
thee

the
future
wife
of
azeez
after
this
she
said
to
me
o
azeez
which
of
the
two
states
is506
the
more
agreeable
to
thee
life
or
death
i
answered
her
life
and
she
said
then
if
life
is
more
agreeable
to
thee
marry
meâi
dislike
i
replied
marrying
such
a
person
as
thou
she
rejoined
if
thou
marry
me
thou
wilt
be
secure
from
the
daughter
of
the
crafty
deleeleh44âand
who
said
i
is
the
daughter
of
the
crafty
deleeleh
she
laughed
and
answered
how
is
it
that
thou
knowest
her
not
when
thou
hast
now
been
in
her
company
a
year
and
four
months
may
allah
whose
name
be
exalted
destroy
her
verily
there
existeth
not
any
one
more
treacherous
than
she
how
many
persons
hath
she
killed
before
thee
and
what
deeds
hath
she
done
and
how
hast
thou
escaped
from
her
without
her
killing
or
troubling
thee
when
thou
hast
been
in
her
company
all
this
timeâwhen
i
heard
her
words
i
wondered
extremely
and
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
who
acquainted
thee
with
her
she
answered
i
know
her
as
the
age
knoweth
its
calamities
but
i
desire
that
thou
inform
me
of
all
that
thou
hast
experienced
from
her
that
i
may
know
the
cause
of
thy
safety
from
her
so
i
related
to
her
all
that
had
happened
to
me
with
her
and
with
my
cousin
azeezeh
and
she
exclaimed
allah
have
mercy
upon
herâand
her
eyes
shed
tears
and
she
struck
her
hands
together
when
she
heard
of
the
death
of
my
cousin
azeezeh
and
said
may
allah
compensate
thee
abundantly
for
the
loss
of
her
o
azeez
for
she
hath
been
the
cause
of
thy
safety
from
the
daughter
of
the
crafty
deleeleh
and
had
it
not
been
for
her
thou
hadst
perished45
after
this
she
clapped
her
hands
and
said
o
my
mother
bring
in
those
who
are
with
thee
and
lo
the
old
woman
approached
with
four
lawful
witnesses
and
she
lighted
four
candles
and
when
the
witnesses
entered
they
saluted
me
and
seated
themselves
and
the
damsel
covered
herself
with
an
izÃr
and
appointed
one
of
the
witnesses
to
be
her
deputy
in
making
her
contract
so
they
performed
the
marriage-contract
and
she
affirmed
of
herself
that
she
had
received
the
whole
of
the
dowry
both
the
portion
usually
paid
in
advance
and
the
arrears
and
that
she
was
indebted
to
me
in
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pieces
of
silver
after
which
she
gave
to
the
witnesses
their
fees
and
they
departed

on
the
following
day
i
desired
to
go
out
but
she
approached
me
laughing
and
said
dost
thou
think
that
going
out
from
the
bath
is
like
entering
it46
i
imagine
thou
thinkest
me
to
be
like
the
daughter
of
the
crafty
deleeleh
beware
of
entertaining
such
an
idea
thou
art
no
other
than
my
husband
according
to
the
áur-Ãn
and
the
sunneh
and
if
thou
hast
been
intoxicated
return507
to
thy
reason
verily
this
house
in
which
thou
art
is
not
opened
but
on
one
day
in
every
year
go
to
the
street-door
and
lookâso
i
went
and
looked
and
found
it
closed
and
nailed
and
returned
and
told
her
so
and
she
said
to
me
o
azeez
we
have
of
flour
and
grain
and
fruits
and
pomegranates
and
sugar
and
meat
and
sheep
and
fowls
and
other
provisions
what
will
suffice
us
for
many
years
and
from
this
last
night
our
door
will
not
be
opened
until
after
a
year
and
i
know
that
thou
wilt
not
behold
thyself
outside
this
house
until
after
a
year
hath
expired
upon
this
i
exclaimed
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
and
she
laughed
and
i
laughed
also
and
complied
with
her
orders
and
remained
with
her
until
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
had
expired
when
i
was
blest
with
a
son
by
her
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
following
year
i
heard
the
opening
of
the
door
and
lo
men
came
in
with
kaáºks47
and
flour
and
sugar
and
i
desired
to
go
out
but
she
said
to
me
wait
until
nightfall
and
as
thou
camest
in
so
go
forth
i
therefore
waited
until
that
hour
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
in
fear
and
trembling
when
she
said
to
me
by
allah
i
will
not
let
thee
go
until
i
have
made
thee
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
return
this
night
before
the
door
is
closed
so
i
promised
her
to
do
it
and
she
made
me
swear
by
binding
oaths
upon
the
sword
and
the
áur-Ãn
and
by
the
oath
of
divorce
that
i
would
return
to
her48

i
then
went
forth
from
her
and
repaired
to
the
garden
i
found
it
open
as
usual
and
was
angry
saying
within
myself
i
have
been
absent
from
this
place
a
whole
year
and
coming
unawares
have
found
it
open
as
usual
i
wonder
if
the
damsel
be
still
there
as
heretofore
and
i
must
enter
and
see
before
i
go
to
my
motherâit
was
then
nightfall
and
i
entered
the
garden
and
proceeding
to
the
maáad
found
the
daughter
of
the
crafty
deleeleh
sitting
with
her
head
upon
her
knee
and
her
hand
upon
her
cheek
her
complexion
was
changed
and
her
eyes
were
sunk
and
when
she
beheld
me
she
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
for
thy
safetyâand
she
endeavoured
to
rise
but
fell
down
through
her
joy
i
was
ashamed
at
seeing
her
and
hung
down
my
head
but
presently
i
advanced
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
said
to
her
how
didst
thou
know
that
i
was
coming
to
thee
at
this
time
she
answered
i
knew
it
not
by
allah
for
a
year
i
have
not
tasted
sleep
but
have
sat
up
every
night
expecting
thee
and
in
this
state
have
i
been
from
the
day
when
thou
wentest
forth
from
me
and
i
gave
thee
the
new
suit
of
clothing
and
thou
promisedst
me
that
thou
wouldst
return
to
me508
i
remained
expecting
thee
and
thou
camest
not
the
first
night
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
so
i
still
waited
in
expectation
of
thy
coming
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
lover
and
i
would
now
that
thou
tell
me
what
hath
been
the
cause
of
thine
absence
from
me
this
year
i
therefore
told
her
and
when
she
knew
that
i
had
married
her
countenance
became
pale
i
then
said
to
her
i
have
come
to
thee
this
night
but
must
go
before
the
morning
but
she
exclaimed
is
it
not
enough
for
her
to
have
married
thee
and
to
have
employed
this
stratagem
against
thee
and
imprisoned
thee
with
her
a
whole
year
that
she
hath
made
thee
swear
by
the
oath
of
divorce
that
thou
wilt
return
to
her
before
the
morning
and
will
not
allow
thee
to
divert
thyself
with
thy
mother
nor
with
me
and
cannot
endure
thy
passing
one
night
with
either
of
us
what
then
must
be
the
state
of
her
from
whom
thou
hast
been
absent
a
whole
year
though
i
knew
thee
before
she
did
but
may
allah
have
mercy
on
azeezeh
for
she
suffered
what
none
other
hath
suffered
and
endured
with
patience
that
of
which
none
else
hath
endured
the
like
and
died
through
thy
oppression
it
was
she
who
protected
thee
from
me
i
thought
that
thou
wouldst
return
and
gave
thee
liberty
though
i
was
able
to
imprison
thee
and
to
destroy
thee

the
punishment
of
azeez
having
thus
said
she
wept
and
became
enraged
and
looked
at
me
with
the
eye
of
anger
and
when
i
beheld
her
in
this
state
the
muscles
of
my
side
quivered
and
i
feared
her
and
became
as
the
bean
upon
the
fire
she
then
cried
out
and
suddenly
ten
female
slaves
came
to
me
and
threw
me
upon
the
floor
and
when
i
fell
under
their
hands
she
arose
and
taking
a
knife
said
i
will509
slaughter
thee
as
goats
are
slaughtered
and
this
shall
be
thy
least
recompense
for
that
which
thou
hast
done
unto
thy
cousin
when
i
beheld
myself
therefore
beneath
her
female
slaves
and
my
cheek
was
soiled
with
the
dust
and
i
saw
the
knife
in
her
hand
i
looked
upon
death
as
inevitable
i
implored
her
mercy
but
she
only
increased
in
hardness
and
ordered
the
female
slaves
to
bind
my
hands
behind
me
and
they
did
so
and
throwing
me
upon
my
back
seated
themselves
upon
my
body
and
held
my
head
then
two
of
them
arose
and
took
hold
of
my
toes
and
two
others
seated
themselves
upon
my
legs
after
which
their
mistress
arose
with
two
others
of
them
and
she
ordered
them
to
beat
me
whereupon
they
beat
me
until
i
fainted
and
my
voice
became
inaudible
and
when
i
recovered
i
said
within
myself
verily
my
being
slaughtered
were
easier
to
me
than
this
beating
i
bethought
myself
of
the
words
of
my
cousin
when
she
said
may
god
avert
from
thee
her
wickednessâand
i
cried
out
and
wept
until
my
voice
failed
she
then
sharpened
the
knife
and
said
to
the
female
slaves
uncover
his
throat
but
god
inspired
me
to
repeat
the
two
phrases
which
my
cousin
had
charged
me
to
utter
namely
fidelity
is
good
and
treachery
is
baseâand
when
she
heard
this
she
cried
out
and
said
allah
have
mercy
upon
thee
o
azeezeh
would
that
thy
youth
had
been
spared
thou
hast
profited
thy
cousin
during
thy
life
and
after
thy
deathâthen
addressing
me
she
added
by
allah
thou
hast
saved
thy
life
from
me
by
means
of
these
two
phrases
but
i
must
cause
thee
to
bear
a
mark
of
my
resentmentâso
saying
she
inflicted
upon
me
a
cruel
wound
and
i
fainted
but
when
i
recovered
the
blood
had
stopped
and
she
gave
me
to
drink
a
cup
of
wine
and
spurned
me
with
her
foot

i
rose
but
was
unable
at
first
to
walk
presently
however
i
proceeded
by
little
and
little
until
i
arrived
at
the
door
of
my
wifes
house
i
found
it
open
and
threw
myself
within
it
in
a
state
of
distraction
and
my
wife
came
and
took
me
up
and
conveyed
me
to
the
saloon
where
i
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
but
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
laid
at
the
gate
of
the
garden

in
anguish
i
rose
and
went
to
my
home
and
entering
the
house
found
my
mother
weeping
for
me
and
exclaiming
would
that
i
knew
o
my
son
in
what
land
thou
art
so
i
approached
her
and
threw
myself
upon
her
and
when
she
beheld
me
she
saw
that
i
was
unwell
yellowness
and
blackness
were
mingled
upon
my
face
and
i
remembered
my
cousin
and
the
kindness
she
had510
shewn
me
and
was
convinced
that
she
loved
me
i
wept
for
her
and
my
mother
also
wept
and
then
said
to
me
o
my
son
thy
father
is
dead
and
upon
this
my
rage
increased
and
i
wept
until
i
became
insensible
and
when
i
recovered
i
looked
towards
the
place
where
my
cousin
was
accustomed
to
sit
and
wept
again
till
i
fainted
from
the
violence
of
my
lamentation
i
ceased
not
to
weep
and
wail
until
midnight
when
my
mother
said
to
me
thy
father
hath
been
dead
ten
days
but
i
replied
i
think
of
no
one
but
my
cousin
for
i
deserve
what
hath
happened
to
me
because
i
neglected
her
when
she
loved
me
she
asked
me
therefore
and
what
hath
happened
to
thee
so
i
related
to
her
that
which
had
befallen
me
to
which
she
replied
praise
be
to
god
that
this
happened
to
thee
and
that
she
did
not
slaughter
thee
she
then
applied
remedies
to
my
wound
until
i
recovered
and
regained
my
usual
strength
and
she
said
to
me
o
my
son
i
will
now
produce
to
thee
the
deposite
with
which
thy
cousin
intrusted
me
for
it
is
thine
and
she
made
me
swear
that
i
would
not
produce
it
to
thee
until
i
saw
that
thou
rememberedst
her
and
mournedst
for
her
and
that
thine
affections
for
another
were
severed
and
now
i
hope
that
i
find
in
thee
these
dispositions
she
therefore
arose
and
opening
a
chest
took
forth
from
it
this
piece
of
linen
containing
the
design
of
the
gazelles
which
i
had
originally
given
to
her
and
when
i
took
it
i
found
written
upon
it
some
verses
complaining
of
her
unrequited
love
for
me
and
there
fell
from
it
a
paper
containing
some
words
of
consolation
and
counsel49

as
soon
as
i
had
read
and
understood
this
paper
i
wept
again
and
my
mother
did
the
same
and
i
continued
looking
at
it
and
weeping
until
the
approach
of
night
and
in
this
state
i
remained
for
the
space
of
a
year
after
which
some
merchants
of
my
city
the
same
whom
i
am
accompanying
in
this
caravan
prepared
for
a
journey
and
my
mother
suggested
to
me
that
i
should
fit
myself
out
and
go
with
them
saying
to
me
perhaps
the
journey
will
dispel
this
sorrow
which
thou
sufferest
and
thou
wilt
be
absent
a
year
or
two
years
or
three
until
the
caravan
returneth
and
thy
heart
may
become
dilated
thus
she
continued
to
persuade
me
so
that
i
prepared
some
merchandise
and
journeyed
with
them
but
my
tears
have
not
dried
up
during
my
travels
for
at
every
station
where
we
halt
i
spread
this
piece
of
linen
before
me
and
look
at
this
design
and
think
of
my
cousin
and
weep
for
her
as
thou
seest
since
she
loved
me
excessively
and
died
through
my
unkindness
i
doing
nothing
but
evil
to
her
while
she
did
nothing
to
me
but
what
was
good511
when
the
merchants
return
from
their
journey
i
shall
return
with
them
and
the
period
of
my
absence
will
be
a
complete
year
but
i
still
suffer
increasing
sorrow
and
my
sorrow
hath
been
only
augmented
in
consequence
of
my
passing
by
the
islands
of
camphor
and
the
castle
of
crystal50

these
islands
are
seven
in
number
and
the
sovereign
of
them
is
a
king
named
shÃh-zemÃn51
he
hath
a
daughter
named
dunyÃ
52
and
it
was
told
me
that
it
was
she
who
worked
the
designs
of
the
gazelles
and
that
this
design
which
is
in
my
possession
was
one
of
her
work
and
when
i
knew
this
i
became
excessively
desirous
of
seeing
her
so
when
the
caravan
entered
her
country
i
went
forth
and
wandered
about
the
gardens
which
contained
a
profusion
of
trees
the
superintendent
of
the
gardens
was
a
sheykh
advanced
in
age
and
i
said
to
him
o
sheykh
to
whom
doth
this
garden
belong
he
answered
to
the
kings
daughter
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
we
are
beneath
her
palace
and
if
thou
desire
to
amuse
thyself
open
the
private
door
and
take
a
view
of
the
garden
and
smell
the
odours
of
the
flowers
so
i
said
to
him
have
the
kindness
to
allow
me
to
sit
in
this
garden
until
she
passeth
by
that
i
may
enjoy
a
glance
at
her
the
sheykh
replied
there
will
be
no
harm
in
thy
doing
so
when
he
said
this
therefore
i
gave
him
some
money
saying
to
him
buy
for
us
something
to
eat
and
he
rejoiced
at
receiving
the
money
and
opening
the
door
conducted
me
within
and
we
proceeded
until
we
came
to
a
pleasant
spot
where
he
brought
me
some
delicate
fruits
and
said
to
me
sit
here
while
i
go
and
return
to
thee
and
he
left
me
and
departed
and
after
he
had
been
absent
a
while
returned
bringing
a
roasted
lamb
and
we
ate
until
we
were
satisfied
my
heart
longing
to
behold
the
lady
and
while
we
were
sitting
lo
the
door
opened
whereupon
he
said
to
me
rise
and
conceal
thyself
so
i
rose
and
hid
myself
and
a
black
eunuch
put
forth
his
head
from
the
door
and
said
o
sheykh
is
any
one
with
thee
he
answered
noâthen
close
the
door
said
the
eunuch
the
sheykh
therefore
closed
the
door
of
the
garden
and
lo
the
lady
dunyÃ

came
forth
when
i
beheld
her
i
thought
that
the
moon
had
descended
upon
the
earth
my
mind
was
confounded
and
i
desired
her
as
the
thirsty
longeth
for
water
and
after
a
while
she
closed
the
door
and
departed
i
then
went
forth
from
the
garden
and
repaired
to
my
lodging
knowing
that
i
could
not
obtain
access
to
her
and
when
my
companions
prepared
for
departure
i
also
prepared
myself
and
travelled
with
them
towards
thy
city
and
on
our
arrival
here
we
met
with512
theeâthis
is
my
story
and
this
is
what
hath
happened
unto
me
and
peace
be
on
thee

the
lady
dunyÃ

continuation
of
the
story
of
tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

when
tÃj-el-mulook
heard
this
story
his
heart
became
troubled
with
love
for
the
lady
dunyÃ

he
then
mounted
his
horse
and
taking
with
him
azeez
returned
to
his
fathers
city
where
he
assigned
to
him
a
house
and
furnished
it
with
everything
that
he
required
after
which
he
left
him
and
repaired
to
his
palace
his
tears
ran
down
upon
his
cheeks
for
hearing
affecteth
as
sight
and
union
and
in
this
state
he
remained
until
his
father
came
in
to
him
and
finding
that
his
colour
was
changed
knew
that
he
was
oppressed
by
anxiety
and
grief
so
he
said
to
him
o
my
son
acquaint
me
with
thy
case
and
tell
me
what
hath
happened
to
thee
to
change
thy513
colour
he
therefore
related
to
him
all
that
he
had
heard
of
the
story
of
dunyÃ

and
how
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
from
hearsay
without
having
seen
her
whereupon
his
father
said
to
him
o
my
son
her
father
is
a
king
and
his
country
is
distant
from
us
abandon
therefore
this
idea
and
enter
the
palace
of
thy
mother
for
in
it
are
five
hundred
female
slaves
like
so
many
moons
and
whoever
of
them
pleaseth
thee
do
thou
take
her
or
if
none
of
them
please
thee
we
will
demand
in
marriage
for
thee
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
kings
more
beautiful
than
the
lady
dunyÃ

but
he
replied
o
my
father
i
desire
not
any
but
her
it
was
she
who
worked
the
design
of
the
gazelles
that
i
saw
and
i
must
have
her
or
i
will
flee
into
the
deserts
and
kill
myself
on
her
account

so
his
father
said
have
patience
with
me
o
my
son
that
i
may
send
to
her
father
and
demand
her
of
him
in
marriage
and
accomplish
for
thee
thy
wish
like
as
i
did
for
myself
in
the
case
of
thy
mother
and
if
he
consent
not
i
will
convulse
his
kingdom
around
him
and
send
against
him
an
army
of
which
the
rear
shall
be
with
me
when
the
van
is
with
him
he
then
called
for
the
young
man
azeez
and
said
to
him
o
my
son
knowest
thou
the
way
he
answered
yesâthen
i
desire
of
thee
said
the
king
that
thou
journey
with
my
wezeer
and
azeez
replied
i
hear
and
obey
o
king
of
the
age
the
king
therefore
summoned
his
wezeer
and
said
to
him
manage
for
me
the
affair
of
my
son
according
to
thy
knowledge
and
repair
to
the
islands
of
camphor
and
demand
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
their
king
he
replied
i
hear
and
obey
and
tÃj-el-mulook
returned
to
his
apartments
and
his
malady
and
impatience
increased
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
recovered
not
until
the
morning
and
when
the
morning
arrived
his
father
came
to
him
and
saw
his
complexion
more
changed
and
his
sallowness
increased
and
he
exhorted
him
to
patience
and
promised
him
the
accomplishment
of
his
union

the
king
then
equipped
azeez
with
his
wezeer
and
supplied
them
with
the
presents
and
they
journeyed
days
and
nights
until
they
beheld
the
islands
of
camphor
when
they
halted
on
the
bank
of
a
river
and
the
wezeer
sent
forward
a
messenger
from
his
party
to
the
king
to
acquaint
him
with
their
approach
and
half
a
day
after
the
departure
of
the
messenger
suddenly
they
saw
that
the
chamberlains
of
the
king
and
his
emeers
had
advanced
to
meet
them
from
the
distance
of
a
league
and
they
met
him
and
attended
them
until
they
went
in
with
them
to
the
king
they
placed514
before
the
king
the
presents
and
remained
in
his
palace
four
days
and
on
the
fifth
day
the
wezeer
arose
and
went
in
to
the
king
and
standing
before
him
delivered
to
him
his
message
and
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
of
his
coming
but
the
king
was
perplexed
how
to
answer
for
his
daughter
liked
not
marriage
and
he
hung
down
his
head
for
a
while
towards
the
floor
and
after
this
he
raised
it
and
looking
towards
one
of
the
eunuchs
said
to
him
go
to
thy
mistress
dunyÃ

and
acquaint
her
with
what
thou
hast
heard
and
with
the
purpose
of
the
visit
of
this
wezeer
so
the
eunuch
went
and
after
a
short
absence
returned
to
the
king
and
said
to
him
o
king
of
the
age
when
i
went
in
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
acquainted
her
with
what
i
had
heard
she
was
violently
enraged
and
rose
against
me
with
a
stick
and
would
have
broken
my
head
wherefore
i
fled
from
her
and
she
said
to
me
if
my
father
force
me
to
marry
him
whom
i
marry
i
will
kill
her
father
therefore
said
to
the
wezeer
and
azeez
salute
ye
the
king
and
inform
him
of
this
and
that
my
daughter
liketh
not
marriage
accordingly
the
wezeer
returned
with
his
attendants
unsuccessful
and
they
continued
their
journey
until
they
went
in
unto
the
king
and
acquainted
him
with
what
had
happened
and
upon
this
he
ordered
the
chiefs
to
call
together
the
troops
that
they
might
march
to
war
but
the
wezeer
said
to
him
do
not
this
for
the
king
is
not
in
fault
the
refusal
is
on
the
part
of
his
daughter
who
when
she
knew
of
this
proposal
sent
to
say
if
my
father
force
me
to
marry
i
will
kill
him
whom
i
marry
and
kill
myself
after
him

and
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
wezeer
he
feared
for
his
son
tÃj-el-mulook
and
said
if
i
make
war
upon
her
father
and
obtain
possession
of
his
daughter
she
will
kill
herself
he
then
acquainted
his
son
tÃj-el-mulook
with
the
truth
of
the
case
and
when
the
prince
heard
it
he
said
to
his
father
o
my
father
i
cannot
exist
without
her
i
will
therefore
go
to
her
and
seek
means
of
obtaining
an
interview
with
her
though
i
die
in
the
attempt
and
i
will
do
nothing
but
this
his
father
said
how
wilt
thou
go
to
her
he
answered
i
will
go
in
the
disguise
of
a
merchantâthen
if
it
must
be
so
rejoined
the
king
take
with
thee
the
wezeer
and
azeez
he
then
took
forth
for
him
some
money
from
his
treasuries
and
prepared
for
him
merchandise
at
the
price
of
a
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
they
both
agreed
as
to
this
course
and
when
night
came
tÃj-el-mulook
and
azeez
went
to
the
abode
of
the
latter
and
there
passed
that
night
but
the
heart
of
tÃj-el-mulook
was515
captivated
and
neither
eating
nor
rest
pleased
him
reflections
overwhelmed
him
and
he
was
drowned
in
them
and
longing
for
his
beloved
he
poured
forth
his
tears
and
wept
violently
and
azeez
wept
with
him
reflecting
upon
his
cousin
and
they
both
continued
thus
until
the
morning
when
tÃj-el-mulook
arose
and
went
in
to
his
mother
he
was
equipped
for
the
journey
and
she
asked
him
respecting
his
state
so
he
acquainted
her
with
the
whole
truth
and
she
gave
him
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
bade
him
farewell
and
he
went
forth
from
her
while
she
offered
up
prayers
for
his
safety
and
for
his
union
with
the
object
of
his
love
he
then
went
in
to
his
father
and
asked
his
permission
to
depart
and
the
king
granted
him
permission
and
gave
him
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
ordered
that
a
tent
should
be
pitched
for
him
outside
the
city

halt
on
the
journey
a
large
tent
was
therefore
pitched
for
him
and
after
they
had
remained
in
it
two
days
they
commenced
their
journey
and
tÃj-el-mulook
treated
azeez
with
familiar
kindness
and
said
to
him
o
my
brother
i
cannot
henceforth
part
with
theeâand
i
replied
azeez
am
of
the
like
mind
and
desire
to
die
at
thy
feet
but
o
my
brother
my
heart
is
troubled
with
thoughts
of
my
mother
so
tÃj-el-mulook516
said
when
we
shall
have
attained
our
wish
all
will
be
well
now
the
wezeer
had
charged
tÃj-el-mulook
to
display
an
air
of
patience
and
azeez
occupied
himself
with
reciting
to
him
verses
and
narrating
to
him
histories
and
tales
and
they
continued
on
their
way
by
night
and
day
for
the
space
of
two
months
the
length
of
the
journey
became
wearisome
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
violence
of
his
desire
and
his
passion
and
distraction
increased
so
when
they
drew
near
to
the
city
he
rejoiced
excessively
and
his
anxiety
and
grief
ceased

they
entered
it
in
the
garb
of
merchants
the
kings
son
being
also
clad
in
the
same
manner
and
coming
to
a
place
known
as
the
abode
of
merchants
which
was
a
large
khÃn
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
azeez
is
this
the
abode
of
the
merchants
azeez
answered
yes
it
is
not
however
the
khÃn
in
which
i
lodged
with
the
caravan
that
i
accompanied
but
it
is
better
than
that
so
they
made
their
camels
lie
down
and
unloaded
and
having
deposited
their
goods
in
the
magazines
remained
there
to
take
rest
four
days
the
wezeer
then
suggested
to
them
that
they
should
hire
for
themselves
a
large
house
to
which
they
assented
and
they
hired
a
spacious
house
fitted
for
festivities
there
they
took
up
their
abode
and
the
wezeer
and
azeez
studied
to
devise
some
stratagem
for
the
sake
of
tÃj-el-mulook
who
was
perplexed
not
knowing
what
to
do
the
wezeer
could
contrive
no
other
plan
than
that
of
his
opening
for
himself
a
shop
to
carry
on
the
trade
of
a
merchant
in
the
market
of
fine
stuffs
he
therefore
addressed
tÃj-el-mulook
and
azeez
and
said
to
them
know
that
if
we
remain
in
this
state
we
shall
not
attain
our
wish
and
a
thing
hath
occurred
to
my
mind
which
probably
may
be
advisable
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
so
they
replied
do
what
seemeth
fit
to
thee
for
a
blessing
attendeth
the
aged
and
especially
in
thy
case
since
thou
hast
devoted
thyself
to
the
management
of
affairs
therefore
give
us
the
advice
which
hath
suggested
itself
to
thy
mind
and
he
said
to
tÃj-el-mulook
it
is
my
opinion
that
we
should
hire
for
thee
a
shop
in
the
market
of
fine
stuffs
and
that
thou
shouldst
sit
in
it
to
sell
and
buy
for
every
person
of
the
higher
ranks
and
of
the
people
in
general
standeth
in
need
of
such
stuffs
and
if
thou
sit
in
that
shop
thy
affair
will
be
arranged
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
especially
because
of
thy
comely
person
but
make
azeez
thy
trusty
attendant
and
seat
him
in
the
shop
to
hand
to
thee
the
stuffs
and
when
tÃj-el-mulook
heard
these
words
he
said
this
is
a
judicious
opinionâand
immediately
he
took
forth
a517
suit
of
merchants
attire
and
clad
himself
in
it
and
arose
and
went
forth
followed
by
his
young
men
and
gave
to
one
of
them
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
to
fit
up
the
shop

they
proceeded
until
they
arrived
at
the
market
of
fine
stuffs
and
when
the
merchants
saw
tÃj-el-mulook
and
observed
his
handsome
and
comely
person
they
were
confounded
and
began
to
say
hath
riáwÃn53
opened
the
gates
of
paradise
and
neglected
them
so
that
this
youth
of
surprising
beauty
hath
come
forthâand
one
said
this
is
probably
one
of
the
angels
and
when
they
went
in
among
the
merchants
they
inquired
for
the
shop
of
the
sheykh
of
the
market
the
merchants
therefore
guided
them
thither
and
they
went
to
him
and
as
they
approached
him
he
and
the
merchants
who
were
with
him
rose
to
them
and
received
them
with
honour
especially
the
excellent
wezeer
for
they
saw
him
to
be
an
aged
and
venerable
man
and
observing
that
he
was
accompanied
by
tÃj-el-mulook
and
azeez
they
said
no
doubt
this
sheykh
is
the
father
of
these
two
young
men
the
wezeer
then
said
to
them
who
among
you
is
the
sheykh
of
the
market
they
answered
this
is
he
and
the
wezeer
looking
at
him
and
observing
him
saw
that
he
was
an
old
man
of
grave
and
respectable
aspect
and
possessing
servants
and
young
men
the
sheykh
of
the
market
greeted
them
with
friendly
compliments
and
treated
them
with
great
honour
and
having
seated
them
by
his
side
said
to
them
have
ye
any
business
which
we
may
have
the
happiness
of
transacting
the
wezeer
answered
yes
i
am
an
old
man
advanced
in
age
and
i
have
these
two
young
men
i
have
travelled
with
them
through
all
regions
and
countries
and
have
not
entered
a
town
without
remaining
in
it
a
whole
year
that
they
might
amuse
themselves
with
the
sight
of
it
and
become
acquainted
with
its
inhabitants
and
now
i
have
come
to
this
your
town
and
have
chosen
to
make
a
stay
in
it
i
therefore
desire
of
thee
one
of
the
best
shops
that
i
may
seat
them
in
it
to
traffic
and
that
they
may
amuse
themselves
with
the
sight
of
this
city
and
acquire
the
manners
of
its
people
and
obtain
an
experience
in
buying
and
selling
and
other
commercial
transactions

so
the
sheykh
of
the
market
replied
there
will
be
no
harm
in
doing
soâand
looking
at
the
two
young
men
he
was
delighted
with
them
and
he
arose
and
stood
like
a
servant
before
them
to
wait
upon
them
and
afterwards
he
went
and
prepared
for
them
the
shop
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
market
and
there
was
none
larger
than
it
nor
any
more
handsome
there
for
it
was
spacious
and518
decorated
and
contained
shelves
of
ivory
and
ebony
he
then
delivered
the
keys
to
the
wezeer
who
was
also
in
the
garb
of
a
merchant
and
said
god
grant
that
it
may
be
attended
with
blessings
to
thy
two
sons54
and
when
the
wezeer
had
taken
the
keys
of
the
shop
he
went
to
it
together
with
the
servants
who
deposited
in
it
their
goods
and
they
ordered
the
servants
to
remove
thither
all
the
merchandise
and
stuffs
and
rarities
that
they
had
these
things
were
worth
treasuries
of
wealth
and
they
transported
the
whole
of
them
to
the
shop
they
then
passed
the
night
and
in
the
morning
the
wezeer
conducted
the
two
young
men
to
the
bath
where
they
washed
and
enjoyed
themselves
to
the
utmost
after
which
they
returned
to
their
abode
to
rest
from
the
fatigue
of
bathing
and
ate
and
drank
and
they
passed
the
next
night
in
their
abode
in
the
most
perfect
joy
and
happiness
and
on
the
following
morning
they
rose
from
their
sleep
and
having
performed
the
ablution
recited
the
divinely-ordained
prayers
and
drank
their
morning-beverage55
and
when
daylight
came
and
the
shops
and
markets
were
opened
they
went
forth
from
their
abode
and
repaired
to
the
market
and
opened
the
shop
the
servants
had
prepared
it
for
them
in
the
handsomest
manner
and
spread
it
with
carpets
of
silk
and
placed
in
it
two
mattresses
each
of
which
was
worth
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
and
upon
each
mattress
they
spread
a
skin
such
as
kings
sit
upon
surrounded
with
an
edge
of
gold
so
tÃj-el-mulook
seated
himself
upon
one
mattress
and
azeez
upon
the
other
and
the
wezeer
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
shop
while
the
servants
stood
before
them
the
people
heard
of
them
and
crowded
about
them
and
they
sold
of
their
merchandise
and
the
fame
of
tÃj-el-mulook
was
spread
through
the
city
and
the
report
of
his
handsomeness
and
comeliness
was
blazed
throughout
it
they
continued
this
life
for
several
days
the
people
pressing
to
them
after
which
the
wezeer
addressed
tÃj-el-mulook
and
enjoined
him
to
conceal
his
case
and
having
charged
azeez
to
keep
watch
over
him
repaired
to
the
house
to
plan
some
mode
of
proceeding
that
might
be
of
advantage
to
them
meanwhile
tÃj-el-mulook
and
azeez
sat
conversing
together
and
the
former
said
perhaps
some
one
may
come
from
the
lady
dunyÃ


tÃj-el-mulook
receiving
the
old
woman
thus
tÃj-el-mulook
passed
his
time
days
and
nights
and
slept
not
desire
overpowered
him
and
he
became
more
and
more
emaciated
and
infirm
renouncing
the
delight
of
sleep
and
abstaining
from
drink
and
food
but
still
he
was
like
the
full
moon
and
as
he
was
sitting
one
day
lo
an
old
woman
approached
and
advanced519
towards
him
followed
by
two
female
slaves
and
she
continued
to
draw
near
until
she
stopped
at
his
shop
beholding
his
graceful
person
and
his
handsome
and
lovely
aspect
she
wondered
at
his
beauty
and
said
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
created
thee
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
him
who
hath
made
thee
a
temptation
to
all
creaturesâshe
ceased
not
to
gaze
at
him
and
said
this
is
not
a
mortal
this
is
no
other
than
a
noble
angel56
then
drawing
close
to
him
she
saluted
him
and
he
returned
her
salutation
and
rose
to
her
standing
upon
his
feet57
and
smiled
in
her
face
all
this
he
did
at
the
hinting
of
azeez
after
which
he
seated
her
by
his
side
and
occupied
himself
with
fanning
her
until
she
had
rested
herself
when
she
said
to
him
o
my
son
o
thou
of
perfect
qualities
and
graces
art
thou
of
this
countryâtÃj-el-mulook
answered
her
with
an
eloquent
and
sweet
and
charming
voice
by
allah
o
my
mistress
in
my
life
i
never
entered
this
country
until
now
and
i
have
not
taken
up
my
abode
in
it
but
for
the
sake
of
amusement
and
she
wished
him
honour
and
welcomed
him
and
said
what
stuffs
hast
thou
brought
with
thee
show
me
something
beautiful
for
the
beautiful
bringeth
not
anything
but
what
is
beautifulâand
when520
tÃj-el-mulook
heard
her
words
his
heart
palpitated
but
he
understood
not
their
meaning
so
azeez
made
a
sign
to
him
and
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
her
i
have
everything
that
thou
desirest
of
stuffs
suitable
only
to
kings
and
the
daughters
of
kings
for
whom
then
wouldst
thou
purchase
that
i
may
display
to
thee
what
will
be
appropriateâhe
desired
by
this
question
to
learn
the
meaning
of
her
words
and
she
answered
i
want
some
stuff
suitable
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

the
daughter
of
king
shÃh-zemÃn
on
hearing
the
mention
of
his
beloved
tÃj-el-mulook
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
said
to
azeez
bring
me
the
most
magnificent
of
the
goods
that
are
by
thee
and
azeez
gave
him
a
wrapper
and
untied
it
before
her
and
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
her
choose
what
will
suit
her
for
this
is
such
as
is
not
found
with
any
but
me
so
the
old
woman
chose
some
stuff
that
was
worth
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
said
what
is
the
price
of
thisâwhat
said
he
shall
i
bargain
with
a
person
like
thee
respecting
this
contemptible
thing
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
made
me
acquainted
with
theeâand
the
old
woman
exclaimed
i
invoke
for
thy
comely
face
the
protection
of
the
lord
of
the
daybreak58
for
verily
thy
face
is
comely
and
so
are
thine
actions
joy
be
to
her
who
possesseth
thee
and
especially
if
she
be
endowed
with
beauty
like
theeâupon
this
tÃj-el-mulook
laughed
until
he
fell
backwards
and
said
within
himself
o
accomplisher
of
desires
by
the
means
of
wicked
old
women59
and
she
said
to
him
o
my
son
what
is
thy
name
he
answered
my
name
is
tÃj-el-mulookâthis
she
replied
is
one
of
the
names
of
kings
but
thou
art
in
the
garb
of
the
merchants
so
azeez
said
from
the
affection
of
his
family
for
him
and
the
high
estimation
in
which
they
held
him
they
gave
him
this
name
and
the
old
woman
replied
thou
hast
spoken
truth
may
god
avert
from
you
the
evil
of
the
envious
though
hearts
be
broken
by
your
charms

she
then
took
the
stuff
and
departed
confounded
by
his
handsomeness
and
loveliness
and
elegant
form
and
she
proceeded
until
she
went
in
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

when
she
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
i
have
brought
thee
some
beautiful
stuffâshew
it
me
said
the
lady
and
she
replied
o
my
mistress
here
it
is
turn
it
over
and
behold
it
and
when
the
lady
dunyÃ

saw
it
she
said
to
her
o
my
nurse
verily
this
is
beautiful
stuff
i
have
not
seen
such
in
our
cityâo
my
mistress
replied
the
old
woman
the
seller
of
it
surpasseth
it
in
beauty
it
seemeth
as
though
riáwÃn
had
opened
the
gates
of
paradise
and
neglected
them
and
so
the
merchant
who
selleth
this
stuff
had
come521
forth
from
it
i
wish
he
were
with
thee
for
he
is
a
temptation
to
every
one
who
beholdeth
him
he
hath
come
to
our
city
with
these
stuffs
for
the
sake
of
amusementâat
these
words
of
the
old
woman
the
lady
dunyÃ

laughed
and
said
allah
afflict
thee
thou
ill-omened
old
woman
thou
hast
spoken
nonsense
and
art
become
insaneâshe
then
added
give
me
the
stuff
that
i
may
examine
it
closely
so
the
old
woman
handed
it
to
her
and
she
looked
at
it
again
and
saw
that
it
was
but
little
and
that
its
price
was
great
and
she
wondered
at
its
beauty
for
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
anything
like
it
the
old
woman
then
said
to
her
o
my
mistress
if
thou
didst
behold
its
owner
thou
wouldst
know
that
he
is
the
handsomest
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

said
to
her
didst
thou
ask
him
if
he
had
any
want
to
be
performed
that
he
might
acquaint
us
with
it
and
thou
mightest
accomplish
it
for
him
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
replied
allah
preserve
thy
sagacity
by
allah
he
hath
a
want
and
is
any
person
without
oneâgo
to
him
then
said
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
salute
him
and
say
to
him
i
have
been
honoured
by
thine
arrival
in
our
city
and
whatever
want
thou
hast
we
will
perform
it
for
thee
on
the
head
and
the
eye

the
old
woman
therefore
returned
immediately
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
when
he
saw
her
his
heart
leaped
with
joy
and
he
rose
to
her
standing
upon
his
feet
and
taking
her
hand
seated
her
by
his
side
so
when
she
had
sat
and
rested
herself
she
informed
him
of
that
which
the
lady
dunyÃ

had
said
on
hearing
this
he
was
filled
with
the
utmost
joy
his
bosom
expanded
and
he
said
within
himself
i
have
accomplished
my
wish
he
then
said
to
the
old
woman
perhaps
thou
wilt
convey
to
her
a
letter
from
me
and
bring
me
back
the
answer
she
replied
i
hear
and
obey
and
when
he
heard
her
reply
he
said
to
azeez
give
me
an
inkhorn
and
paper
and
a
pen
of
brass
and
azeez
having
given
him
these
things
he
wrote
the
following
versesâ

i
write
to
thee
a
letter
o
object
of
my
petition
expressive
of
the
torment
that
i
suffer
from
separation
and
first
i
make
known
to
thee
the
ardour
of
my
heart
and
secondly
my
desire
and
eager
longing
and
thirdly
the
expiring
of
my
life
and
patience
and
fourthly
that
all
the
violence
of
my
love
remaineth
and
fifthly
i
ask
when
shall
i
behold
thee
and
sixthly
when
shall
be
the
day
of
our
union
he
then
added
beneath
this
letter
is
from
the
captive
of
desire
incarcerated
in
the
prison
of
longing
expectation
to
whom
there
can522
be
no
liberation
but
by
enjoying
an
interview
even
were
it
with
the
phantom
of
the
object
of
his
hope
for
he
is
enduring
a
painful
torment
from
the
separation
of
his
belovedâthen
his
tears
flowed
and
he
wrote
these
two
versesâ

i
write
unto
thee
with
my
tears
flowing
and
the
drops
from
my
eyes
descending
incessantly
but
i
am
not
despairing
of
the
favour
of
my
lord
perhaps
some
day
our
union
may
take
place
he
then
folded
the
letter
and
sealed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
old
woman
saying
convey
it
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

she
replied
i
hear
and
obey
and
he
gave
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
said
receive
this
as
a
present
from
me
so
the
old
woman
took
it
and
departed
praying
for
him

she
stopped
not
until
she
went
in
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

who
when
she
beheld
her
said
to
her
o
my
nurse
what
hath
he
demanded
that
we
should
do
for
himâo
my
mistress
she
answered
he
hath
sent
with
me
a
letter
and
i
know
not
its
contents
and
she
handed
the
letter
to
her
so
the
lady
dunyÃ

took
it
and
read
it
and
understood
its
meaning
and
exclaimed
whence
is
he
and
to
what
doth
he
aspire
that
this
merchant
openeth
a
correspondence
with
me
then
slapping
her
face
she
said
were
it
not
for
my
fear
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
i
would
crucify
him
upon
his
shop
so
the
old
woman
said
to
her
what
is
in
this
letter
that
it
hath
disturbed
thy
heart
doth
it
contain
a
complaint
of
oppression
or
a
demand
for
the
price
of
the
stuffâwo
to
thee
she
answered
it
containeth
not
that
nor
anything
but
love
and
affection
and
all
this
is
through
thee
or
if
not
how
should
this
devil
presume
to
employ
these
wordsâo
my
mistress
replied
the
old
woman
thou
art
residing
in
thy
lofty
palace
and
no
one
can
obtain
access
to
thee
not
even
the
flying
bird
allah
preserve
thee
from
blame
and
censure
thou
hast
nothing
to
fear
from
the
barking
of
dogs
be
not
angry
with
me
for
my
bringing
thee
this
letter
when
i
knew
not
its
contents
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
thou
shouldst
return
him
an
answer
and
threaten
him
in
it
with
slaughter
and
forbid
him
from
employing
these
vain
words
for
he
will
abstain
and
not
do
so
againâthe
lady
dunyÃ

said
i
fear
to
write
to
him
lest
he
covet
me
more
but
the
old
woman
replied
when
he
heareth
the
threatening
and
promise
of
punishment
he
will
desist
from
his
present
conduct
so
she
said
bring
me
an
inkhorn
and
paper
and
a
pen
of
brass
and
when
they
had
brought
them
to
her
she
wrote
these
verses523â

o
pretender
to
love
and
affliction
and
sleeplessness
and
feelings
of
rapturous
passion
and
anxiety
dost
thou
seek
for
a
meeting
o
deceived
from
a
moon
doth
any
attain
from
a
moon
his
wish
i
advise
thine
abstaining
from
thy
desire
forbear
then
for
thou
art
exposed
to
peril
if
thou
again
make
use
of
these
words
i
will
visit
thee
with
a
punishment
of
the
utmost
severity
by
him
who
created
mankind
of
clotted
blood60
and
who
gave
light
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
if
thou
repeat
the
proposal
thou
hast
made
i
will
assuredly
crucify
thee
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
the
lady
dunyÃ

writing
she
then
folded
up
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
the
old
woman
saying
to
her
deliver
it
to
him
and
say
to
him
abstain
from
these
words
and
she
replied
i
hear
and
obey

she
took
the
letter
full
of
joy61
and
went
with
it
to
her
house
where
she
passed
the
night
and
in
the
morning
she
repaired
to
the
shop
of
tÃj-el-mulook
whom
she
found
expecting
her
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
he
almost
flew
with
joy
and
when
she
drew
near
to
him
he
rose
to
her
standing
upon
his
feet
and
seated
her
by
his
side
and
she
took
forth
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
him
saying
read
its
contents
she
then
said
to
him
the
lady
dunyÃ

when
she
read
thy
letter
was
enraged
but
i
coaxed
her
and
jested
with
her
until
i
made
her
laugh
and
she
was
moved
with
pity
for
thee
and
returned
thee
an
answer
so
tÃj-el-mulook
thanked
her
for
this
and
having
ordered
azeez
to
give
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
read
the
letter
and
understood
it
and
he
wept
violently
so
that
the
heart
of
the
old
woman
was
moved
with
compassion
for
him
and
his
weeping
and
complaining
grieved
her
she
said
to
him
o
my
son
and
what
is
in524
this
paper
that
it
hath
made
thee
weep
he
answered
she
threateneth
me
with
slaughter
and
crucifixion
and
forbiddeth
my
writing
to
her
but
if
i
write
not
to
her
my
death
will
be
preferable
to
my
life
therefore
take
a
reply
to
her
letter
and
let
her
do
what
she
willâby
thy
youth
replied
the
old
woman
i
must
risk
my
life
for
thee
and
enable
thee
to
attain
thy
desire
and
accomplish
for
thee
that
which
is
in
thy
heart
and
tÃj-el-mulook
said
whatsoever
thou
dost
i
will
requite
thee
for
it
and
it
shall
be
determined
by
thee
for
thou
art
experienced
in
the
management
of
affairs
and
skilled
in
the
modes
of
intrigue
and
everything
that
is
difficult
becometh
easy
to
thee
and
god
is
able
to
accomplish
all
things
so
he
took
a
paper
and
wrote
in
it
these
versesâ

she
threatened
me
with
slaughter
o
my
bereavement
slaughter
would
be
ease
to
me
and
death
is
decreed
death
is
better
than
life
prolonged
to
the
love-smitten
who
is
debarred
from
enjoyment
and
treated
with
oppression
by
allah
visit
a
helpless
lover
for
i
am
your
slave
and
the
slave
is
in
captivity
o
my
mistress
have
mercy
on
me
for
my
passion
for
every
one
who
loveth
the
virtuous
is
excusable
having
done
this
he
sighed
heavily
and
wept
until
the
old
woman
wept
with
him
after
which
she
took
the
letter
from
him
and
said
to
him
be
happy
and
cheerful
for
i
must
accomplish
for
thee
thy
wish

she
then
arose
and
left
him
as
though
he
were
upon
the
fire
and
repaired
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

whom
she
found
with
a
countenance
changed
by
her
anger
in
consequence
of
the
former
epistle
of
tÃj-el-mulook
and
she
handed
her
the
second
letter
whereupon
her
rage
increased
and
she
said
to
the
old
woman
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
covet
us
moreâand
what
is
this
dog
said
the
old
woman
that
he
should
aspire
to
thee
the
lady
dunyÃ

replied
go
to
him
and
say
to
him
if
thou
write
to
her
again
she
will
strike
off
thy
head
but
the
old
woman
said
do
thou
write
this
to
him
in
a
letter
and
i
will
take
it
with
me
that
his
fear
may
be
the
greater
so
she
took
a
paper
and
wrote
in
it
the
following
versesâ

o
thou
who
art
heedless
of
the
course
of
misfortunes
and
who
canst
not
accomplish
thy
desired
union
dost
thou
think
o
deceived
to
attain
to
es-suhÃ
62
when
thou
canst
not
reach
to
the
shining
moon
how
then
dost
thou
venture
to
hope
for
our
union
and
to
hold
in
thine
embrace
my
javelin-like
form
quit
therefore
this
project
in
fear
of
my
assault
on
a
day
of
adversity
when
hair
shall
become
gray
525
having
folded
this
letter
she
handed
it
to
the
old
woman
who
took
it
and
repaired
with
it
to
tÃj-el-mulook
at
the
sight
of
her
he
rose
and
said
may
god
never
deprive
me
of
the
blessing
of
thy
coming
and
the
old
woman
replied
receive
the
answer
to
thy
letter
so
he
took
the
paper
and
read
it
and
wept
violently
and
said
i
desire
now
some
one
to
kill
me
for
slaughter
would
be
easier
to
me
than
this
my
present
state
of
suffering
he
then
took
an
inkhorn
and
a
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
a
letter
expressed
in
these
two
versesâ

o
my
hope
persist
not
in
abandonment
and
cruelty
but
visit
a
lover
drowned
in
desire
think
not
that
i
can
survive
this
oppression
for
my
soul
departeth
at
the
loss
of
my
beloved
and
he
folded
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
the
old
woman
saying
to
her
i
have
wearied
thee
to
no
purpose
and
again
he
ordered
azeez
to
give
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
said
to
her
o
my
mother
this
paper
must
be
followed
by
complete
union
or
complete
separationâo
my
son
she
replied
by
allah
i
desire
for
thee
nothing
but
good
fortune
and
i
wish
she
may
be
with
thee
for
thou
art
the
shining
moon
and
she
is
the
rising
sun
and
if
i
do
not
bring
you
together
no
profit
will
remain
to
me
in
my
life
i
have
passed
my
life
in
the
practice
of
artifice
and
deceit
until
i
have
attained
the
age
of
ninety
years
and
how
then
should
i
fail
of
uniting
two
persons
in
opposition
to
all
law

then
having
bidden
him
farewell
and
soothed
his
mind
she
departed
and
proceeded
without
stopping
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

but
she
had
hidden
the
paper
in
her
hair
and
when
she
sat
down
with
her
mistress
she
scratched
her
head
and
said
o
my
mistress
perhaps
thou
wilt
untwist
my
hair
for
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
entered
the
bath
so
the
lady
dunyÃ

made
bare
her
arms
to
the
elbows
and
untwisted
the
old
womans
hair
whereupon
the
paper
fell
from
her
head
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

seeing
it
said
what
is
this
paper
the
old
woman
answered
it
seemeth
that
when
i
was
sitting
at
the
shop
of
the
merchant
this
paper
caught
to
me
give
it
me
therefore
that
i
may
return
it
to
him
but
the
lady
dunyÃ

opened
it
and
read
it
and
understood
its
contents
and
exclaimed
this
is
a
trick
of
thine
and
were
it
not
for
the
fact
of
thy
having
reared
me
i
would
lay
violent
hands
upon
thee
this
moment
god
hath
afflicted
me
by
this
merchant
and
all
that
i
have
experienced
from
him
hath
been
through
thy
means
i
know
not
from
what
country
this
man
hath
come
no526
one
but
he
could
ever
use
such
boldness
towards
me
i
fear
that
this
affair
which
hath
happened
to
me
may
be
discovered
and
especially
since
it
relateth
to
a
man
who
is
neither
of
my
family
nor
of
my
equalsâthe
old
woman
then
addressed
her
and
said
no
one
can
utter
a
word
on
this
subject
through
fear
of
thy
power
and
of
the
dignity
of
thy
father
and
there
will
be
no
harm
in
thy
returning
him
an
answerâo
my
nurse
replied
the
lady
dunyÃ

this
is
a
devil
how
hath
he
dared
to
use
these
words
and
feared
not
the
power
of
the
suláÃn
i
am
perplexed
respecting
his
case
for
if
i
give
orders
to
kill
him
it
will
not
be
right
and
if
i
leave
him
he
will
increase
in
his
boldnessâwrite
to
him
a
letter
rejoined
the
old
woman
and
perhaps
he
will
be
restrained
she
therefore
demanded
a
paper
and
an
inkhorn
and
a
pen
and
wrote
to
him
the
following
versesâ

though
repeatedly
rebuked
still
gross
ignorance
inciteth
thee
how
oft
shall
my
hand
write
verses
to
forbid
thee
thou
increasest
in
eagerness
after
each
prohibition
but
i
will
only
permit
thee
to
conceal
thy
secret
conceal
then
thy
love
and
never
more
utter
it
for
if
thou
utter
it
i
will
not
regard
thee
if
thou
repeat
what
thou
hast
said
the
raven
of
separation
will
announce
thy
fate
527
in
a
little
time
will
death
overtake
thee
and
thy
resting-place
be
beneath
the
earth
thou
shalt
leave
thy
family
o
deceived
in
sorrow
when
the
swords
of
love
have
prevented
thine
escape
the
lady
dunyÃ

untwisting
the
old
womans
hair
having
then
folded
the
paper
she
gave
it
to
the
old
woman
who
took
it
and
went
with
it
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
gave
it
to
him
and
when
he
had
read
it
and
was
convinced
that
she
was
hard-hearted
and
that
he
could
not
obtain
access
to
her
he
complained
of
his
case
to
the
wezeer
and
desired
his
prudent
counsel
the
wezeer
replied
know
that
there
remaineth
for
thee
nothing
that
can
be
of
avail
except
thy
writing
to
her
another
letter
and
invoking
retribution
upon
her
so
he
said
o
my
brother
o
azeez
write
in
my
stead
according
to
thy
knowledge
and
azeez
took
the
paper
and
wrote
these
versesâ

o
my
lord
by
the
five
elders63
deliver
me
and
to
her
who
hath
afflicted
me
transfer
my
anguish
for
thou
knowest
that
i
am
suffering
a
tormenting
flame
and
my
beloved
hath
oppressed
me
and
will
not
pity
me
how
long
shall
i
feel
tenderly
to
her
in
my
affliction
and
how
long
shall
she
tyrannize
over
my
weakness
i
wander
in
agonies
never
ending
and
find
not
a
person
o
my
lord
to
assist
me
azeez
then
folded
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
when
he
had
read
it
it
pleased
him
and
he
gave
it
to
the
old
woman

so
she
took
it
and
repaired
with
it
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

who
as
soon
as
she
had
read
it
and
understood
its
contents
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
exclaimed
all
that
hath
befallen
me
hath
been
through
the
means
of
this
ill-omened
old
woman
and
she
called
out
to
the
female
slaves
and
eunuchs
and
said
seize
this
artful
old
woman
and
beat
her
with
your
slippersâso
they
fell
to
beating
her
with
their
slippers
until
she
fainted
and
when
she
recovered
the
lady
dunyÃ

said
to
her
o
wicked
old
woman
were
it
not
for
my
fear
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
i
had
killed
thee
she
then
said
to
her
attendants
beat
her
again
and
they
beat
her
again
until
she
fainted
after
which
she
ordered
them
to
throw
her
outside
the
door
and
they
dragged
her
along
upon
her
face
and
threw
her
down
before
the
door

the
old
woman
beaten
by
female
slaves
when
she
recovered
therefore
she
rose
and
walking
and
resting
now
and
then
arrived
at
her
abode
she
waited
until
the
morning
and
then
rose
and
proceeded
to
tÃj-el-mulook
whom
she
acquainted
with
all
that
had
befallen
her
and
it
vexed
him
and
he
said
to
her
we
are
grieved
o
my
mother
for
that
which
hath
happened
to
thee528
but
everything
is
in
accordance
with
fate
and
destiny
she
replied
be
happy
and
cheerful
for
i
will
not
cease
my
endeavours
until
i
procure
thee
an
interview
with
her
and
obtain
for
thee
access
to
this
vile
woman
who
hath
tortured
me
with
beating
tÃj-el-mulook
then
said
to
her
acquaint
me
with
the
cause
of
her
hatred
of
men
she
replied
it
is
in
consequence
of
her
having
had
a
dreamâand
what
was
that
dream
he
asked
she
answered
she
was
sleeping
one
night
and
saw
a
fowler
who
set
his
snare
upon
the
ground
and
sprinkled
around
it
some
wheat
and
then
seated
himself
near
it
and
there
was
not
a
single
bird
near
it
but
it
came
to
that
snare
and
she
saw
among
the
birds
two
pigeons
a
male
and
a
female
and
while
she
was
looking
at
the
snare
the
foot
of
the
male
bird
became
entangled
in
it
and
he
began
to
struggle
whereupon
all
the
other
birds
flew
away
from
him
in
alarm
but
his
mate
returned
to
him
and
flew
around
over
him
and
then
alighting
upon
the
snare
while
the
fowler
was
inadvertent
began
to
peck
at
the
mesh
in
which
was
the
foot
of
the
male
and
pulled
it
with
her
beak
until
she
liberated
his
foot
and
she
flew
away
with
him
then
after
this
the
fowler529
came
and
readjusted
the
snare
and
seated
himself
at
a
distance
from
it
and
but
a
little
while
had
elapsed
when
the
birds
descended
and
the
snare
caught
the
female
pigeon
upon
which
all
the
other
birds
flew
away
in
alarm
and
among
them
the
male
pigeon
who
returned
not
to
his
mate
so
the
fowler
came
and
took
the
female
bird
and
killed
her
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

awoke
terrified
by
her
dream
and
said
every
male
is
like
this
destitute
of
good
and
men
universally
are
devoid
of
goodness
to
womenâand
when
the
old
woman
had
finished
her
story
to
tÃj-el-mulook
he
said
to
her
o
my
mother
i
wish
to
obtain
one
glance
at
her
though
my
death
be
the
consequence
contrive
therefore
some
stratagem
for
me
that
i
may
see
herâknow
then
said
she
that
she
hath
a
garden
adjacent
to
her
palace
for
her
diversion
and
she
goeth
out
into
it
once
in
every
month
from
the
private
door
and
remaineth
in
it
ten
days
the
time
of
her
thus
going
forth
to
divert
herself
hath
now
arrived
and
when
she
is
about
to
do
so
i
will
come
to
thee
and
inform
thee
that
thou
mayest
go
thither
and
meet
her
and
do
thou
take
care
not
to
quit
the
garden
for
probably
if
she
behold
thy
handsome
and
comely
aspect
her
heart
will
be
captivated
by
love
of
thee
since
love
is
the
most
powerful
means
of
effecting
union

he
replied
i
hear
and
obeyâand
he
arose
and
quitted
the
shop
with
azeez
and
they
both
taking
with
them
the
old
woman
repaired
to
their
abode
and
acquainted
her
with
it
after
which
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
azeez
o
my
brother
i
have
no
further
want
of
the
shop
for
i
have
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
i
took
it
and
i
give
it
to
thee
with
all
that
it
containeth
because
thou
hast
come
abroad
with
me
and
absented
thyself
from
thy
country
and
azeez
accepted
his
present
and
they
sat
conversing
together
tÃj-el-mulook
asking
him
respecting
his
strange
adventures
and
azeez
relating
what
had
happened
to
him
then
addressing
the
wezeer
they
acquainted
him
with
the
purpose
of
tÃj-el-mulook
and
asked
him
what
is
to
be
done
he
answered
let
us
go
to
the
garden
so
each
of
them
clad
himself
in
the
richest
of
his
apparel
and
they
went
forth
followed
by
three
memlooks
and
repaired
to
the
garden
they
beheld
it
abounding
with
trees
and
with
many
rivulets
and
saw
the
superintendent
sitting
at
the
gate
they
saluted
him
therefore
and
he
returned
their
salutation
and
the
wezeer
handed
to
him
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
saying
to
him
i
beg
thee
to
receive
this
money
and
to
buy
for
us
something
to
eat
for
we
are
strangers
and
i
have
with
me
these
children
whom
i
wish
to
divert
so
the
gardener
took
the
pieces
of530
gold
and
replied
enter
and
divert
yourselves
for
the
whole
of
it
is
your
property
and
sit
down
until
i
return
to
you
with
something
for
you
to
eat
he
then
went
to
the
market
and
the
wezeer
and
tÃj-el-mulook
and
azeez
entered
the
garden
after
the
gardener
had
departed
to
the
market
and
soon
the
latter
returned
bringing
a
roasted
lamb
which
he
placed
before
them
and
they
ate
and
washed
their
hands
and
sat
conversing
together
and
the
wezeer
said
inform
me
respecting
this
garden
doth
it
belong
to
thee
or
dost
thou
rent
it
the
sheykh
replied
it
is
not
mine
but
belongeth
to
the
kings
daughter
the
lady
dunyÃ
âand
what
said
the
wezeer
is
thy
monthly
salary
he
answered
one
piece
of
gold
and
no
more
and
the
wezeer
taking
a
view
of
the
garden
beheld
there
a
lofty
but
old
pavilion
and
he
said
o
sheykh
i
desire
to
perform
here
a
good
work
by
which
thou
wilt
be
reminded
of
meâand
what
good
thing
dost
thou
desire
to
do
asked
the
sheykh
the
wezeer
said
take
these
three
hundred
pieces
of
gold
and
when
the
superintendent
heard
the
mention
of
the
gold
he
replied
o
my
master
do
whatsoever
thou
wilt
so
he
took
the
pieces
of
gold
and
the
wezeer
said
to
him
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
whose
name
be
exalted
we
will
execute
in
this
place
a
good
work

they
then
went
forth
from
him
and
returned
to
their
abode
and
passed
the
next
night
and
on
the
morrow
the
wezeer
caused
a
whitewasher
to
be
brought
and
a
painter
and
an
excellent
goldsmith
and
having
provided
them
with
all
the
implements
that
they
required
introduced
them
into
the
garden
and
ordered
them
to
whitewash
that
pavilion
and
to
decorate
it
with
various
kinds
of
paintings
after
which
he
gave
orders
to
bring
the
gold
and
the
ultramarine
pigment
and
said
to
the
painter
delineate
at
the
upper
end
of
this
saloon
the
figure
of
a
fowler
as
though
he
had
set
his
snare
and
a
female
pigeon
had
fallen
into
it
and
had
become
entangled
in
it
by
her
bill
and
when
the
painter
had
finished
his
picture
on
one
portion
the
wezeer
said
to
him
now
paint
on
this
other
portion
as
before
and
represent
the
female
pigeon
in
the
snare
and
shew
that
the
fowler
hath
taken
her
and
put
the
knife
to
her
neck
and
on
the
other
side
paint
the
figure
of
a
great
bird
of
prey
that
hath
captured
the
male
pigeon
and
fixed
his
talons
into
him
so
he
did
this
and
when
he
had
finished
these
designs
which
the
wezeer
had
described
to
him
they
took
leave
of
the
gardener
and
returned
to
their
abode

there
they
sat
conversing
together
and
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
azeez
o
my
brother
recite
to
me
some
verses
perhaps
my
heart531
may
thereby
be
dilated
and
these
troubling
reflections
may
be
dispelled
and
the
flame
that
is
in
my
heart
be
quenched
and
upon
this
azeez
with
charming
modulations
chanted
these
versesâ

hath
asserted
that
the
lovers
remedy
consisteth
in
melodious
sounds
and
the
company
of
one
like
his
beloved
and
the
pleasures
of
a
dessert
and
wine
and
a
garden
but
i
have
taken
another
in
thy
stead
to
cure
myself
and
fate
and
contingency
aided
me
yet
i
found
that
love
was
a
mortal
disease
for
which
ibn-seenÃ
s
medicine
was
vain
meanwhile
the
old
woman
remained
alone
in
her
house
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

longed
to
divert
herself
in
the
garden
but
she
used
not
to
go
forth
save
with
the
old
woman
so
she
sent
to
her
and
conciliated
her
and
soothed
her
mind
and
said
to
her
i
desire
to
go
out
into
the
garden
to
amuse
myself
with
the
sight
of
its
trees
and
fruits
and
that
my
heart
may
be
dilated
by
its
flowers
the
old
woman
replied
i
hear
and
obey
but
i
would
first
go
to
my
house
and
dress
myself
and
i
will
be
with
thee
againâgo
then
to
thy
house
rejoined
the
lady
dunyÃ

but
be
not
long
absent
from
me
the
old
woman
therefore
went
forth
from
her
and
repaired
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
said
to
him
make
ready
and
clothe
thyself
in
the
richest
of
thine
apparel
and
betake
thyself
to
the
garden
and
go
in
to
the
gardener
and
salute
him
and
then
conceal
thyself
in
the
garden
he
replied
i
hear
and
obey
and
she
agreed
with
him
respecting
a
sign
to
be
made
after
which
she
returned
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
when
she
had
gone
the
wezeer
arose
and
clad
tÃj-el-mulook
in
a
suit
of
the
most
magnificent
of
the
apparel
of
kings
worth
five
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
girded
him
with
a
girdle
of
gold
set
with
jewels
and
repaired
to
the
garden
on
arriving
at
its
gate
they
found
the
superintendent
sitting
there
and
when
he
saw
tÃj-el-mulook
he
rose
to
him
standing
upon
his
feet
and
receiving
him
with
reverence
and
honour
opened
to
him
the
gate
and
said
to
him
enter
and
divert
thyself
in
the
garden
but
the
gardener
knew
not
that
the
kings
daughter
would
enter
the
garden
that
day
and
when
tÃj-el-mulook
had
gone
in
he
waited
but
a
short
time
and
heard
a
noise
and
before
he
knew
the
cause
the
eunuchs
and
female
slaves
came
forth
from
the
private
door
and
as
soon
as
the
superintendent
beheld
them
he
went
and
acquainted
tÃj-el-mulook
with
their
coming
saying
to
him
o
my
lord
what
is
to
be
done
now
that
the
kings
daughter
the
lady
dunyÃ

hath
come
he
answered
no
harm
will
befall
thee
for
i
will
conceal
myself
in
some
place
in
the
garden

the
stratagem
in

dunyÃs
garden
the
gardener
charged
him
to
use
the
utmost
caution
in
concealing
himself
and
left
him
and
departed

and
when
the
kings
daughter
with
her
female
slaves
and
the
old
woman
entered
the
garden
the
old
woman
said
within
herself
if
the
eunuchs
be
with
us
we
shall
not
attain
our
wish
so
she
said
to
the
kings
daughter
o
my
mistress
i
would
propose
to
thee
a
thing
productive
of
ease
to
thy
heart
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

replied
propose
what
thou
wilt
the
old
woman
therefore
said
o
my
mistress
thou
hast
no
need
of
these
eunuchs
at
the
present
time
nor
will
thy
heart
be
dilated
as
long
as
they
are
with
us
so
dismiss
them
from
usâthou
hast
spoken
truly
replied
the
lady
dunyÃ
âand
she
dismissed
them
and
a
little
while
after
as
she
was
walking
tÃj-el-mulook
beheld
her
and
gazed
at
her
beauty
and
loveliness
while
she
knew
it
not
and
every
time
that
he
looked
at
her
he
fainted
by
reason
of
her
surpassing
beauty
the
old
woman
in
the
meantime
led
her
on
by
conversation
to
the
pavilion
which
the
wezeer
had
ordered
to
be
painted
and
entering
this
pavilion
the
lady
dunyÃ

took
a
view
of
its
paintings
and
saw
the
birds
and
the
fowler
and
the
pigeons
whereupon
she
exclaimed
extolled
be
the
perfection
of
god
verily
this
is
the
representation
of
what
i
beheld
in
my
dreamâand

illustrations
of
the
stratagem
in
the
lady
dunyÃs
garden
she
continued
gazing
at
the
figures
of
the
birds
and
the
fowler
and
the
snare
full
of
wonder
and
said
o
my
nurse
i
used
to
censure
men
and
hate
them
but
see
the
fowler
how
he533
hath
killed
the
female
bird
and
the
male
hath
escaped
and
desired
to
return
to
the
female
to
liberate
her
but
the
bird
of
prey
hath
met
him
and
captured
him
the
old
woman
however
affected
ignorance
to
her
and
proceeded
to
divert
her
with
talk
until
they
both
approached
the
place
where
tÃj-el-mulook
was
concealed
upon
which
she
made
a
sign
to
him
that
he
should
walk
beneath
the
windows
of
the
pavilion
and
while
the
lady
dunyÃ

stood
there
she
looked
aside
and
saw
him
and
observing
the
beauty
of
his
face
and
his
elegant
form
she
said
o
my
nurse
whence
is
this
handsome
youth
the
old
woman
answered
i
know
him
not
but
i
imagine
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
great
king
for
he
is
of
the
utmost
beauty
and
loveliness
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

was
enraptured
with
him
the
spells
that
bound
her
were
dissolved
her
reason
was
overcome
by
his
beauty
and
loveliness
and
his
elegant
person
and
she
was
affected
by
violent
love
so
she
said
to
the
old
woman
o
my
nurse
verily
this
young
man
is
handsome
the
old
woman
replied
thou
hast
spoken
truth
o
my
mistress
and
she
made
a
sign
to
the
kings
son
to
return
to
his
house
the
fire
of
desire
flamed
within
him
and
his
rapture
and
distraction
became
excessive
but
he
went
and
bade
farewell
to
the
superintendent
and
departed
to
his
abode
that
he
might
not
disobey
the
old
woman
and
acquainted
the
wezeer
and
azeez
that
she
had
made
a
sign
to
him
to
depart
and
they
both
exhorted
him
to
be
patient
saying
to
him
if
the
old
woman
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
object
to
be
attained
by
thy
return
she
had
not
made
a
sign
to
thee
to
do
so

now
to
return
to
the
lady
dunyÃ
âdesire
overcame
her
and
her
rapture
and
distraction
increased
so
she
said
to
the
old
woman
i
know
not
how
to
obtain
an
interview
with
this
young
man
but
through
thy
means
the
old
woman
exclaimed
i
seek
refuge
with
allah
from
satan
the
accursed
thou
hast
no
desire
for
men
and
how
then
have
fears
affected
thee
in
consequence
of
the
love
of
him
but
by
allah
none
other
than
he
is
suited
to
thy
youthâo
my
nurse
rejoined
the
lady
dunyÃ

assist
me
to
obtain
an
interview
with
him
and
thou
shalt
receive
from
me
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
a
dress
of
the
same
value
if
thou
assist
me
not
to
gain
him
i
shall
die
inevitably
so
the
old
woman
replied
go
thou
to
thy
palace
and
i
will
devise
means
to
bring
you
together
and
give
my
life
to
satisfy
you
both
the
lady
dunyÃ

then
returned
to
her
palace
while
the
old
woman
repaired
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
when
he
saw
her
he
rose
to
her
and
stood
and
received
her
with
respect
and
honour
seating
her
by
his
side
and
she
said
to
him
the
stratagem
hath
succeeded
she534
then
related
to
him
what
had
occurred
between
her
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
he
said
to
her
when
shall
be
the
interview
she
answered
to-morrow
and
he
gave
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
a
garment
of
the
same
value
and
she
took
them
and
departed
and
stopped
not
until
she
went
in
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

who
said
to
her
o
my
nurse
what
news
hast
thou
brought
from
the
belovedâi
have
discovered
his
abode
she
answered
and
to-morrow
i
will
bring
him
to
thee
and
at
this
the
lady
dunyÃ

rejoiced
and
gave
her
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
a
garment
of
the
same
value
and
she
took
them
and
returned
to
her
house

she
passed
the
next
night
and
in
the
morning
she
went
forth
and
repaired
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
having
clad
him
in
womens
apparel
said
to
him
walk
behind
me
and
incline
thy
body
from
side
to
side
as
thou
steppest65
and
proceed
not
with
a
hasty
pace
nor
take
notice
of
any
one
who
may
speak
to
thee
and
after
she
had
thus
charged
him
she
went
forth
and
he
behind
her
in
his
female
attire
and
she
proceeded
to
instruct
him
on
the
way
how
to
act
that
he
might
not
fear
she
continued
on
her
way
he
following
her
until
they
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
palace
when
she
entered
and
he
also
after
her
and
she
passed
through
successive
doors
and
antechambers
until
she
had
conducted
him
through
seven
doors
and
when
she
arrived
at
the
seventh
door
she
said
to
tÃj-el-mulook
fortify
thy
heart
and
if
i
call
out
to
thee
and
say
to
thee
o
slave-girl
advanceâbe
not
tardy
in
thy
pace
but
hasten
on
and
when
thou
hast
entered
the
antechamber
beyond
look
to
thy
left
thou
wilt
see
a
saloon
with
seven
doors
and
do
thou
count
five
doors
and
enter
the
sixth
for
within
it
is
the
object
of
thy
desireâand
whither
goest
thou
said
tÃj-el-mulook
she
answered
i
have
no
place
to
go
to
but
perhaps
i
may
wait
after
thee
and
speak
with
the
chief
eunuch
she
then
proceeded
and
he
followed
her
until
they
arrived
at
the
door
where
was
the
chief
eunuch
and
he
saw
with
her
tÃj-el-mulook
in
the
attire
of
a
female
slave
and
said
to
her
what
is
the
business
of
this
slave-girl
who
is
with
thee
she
answered
him
the
lady
dunyÃ

hath
heard
that
this
girl
is
skilled
in
different
kinds
of
work
and
she
desireth
to
purchase
her
but
the
eunuch
replied
i
know
neither
slave-girl
nor
any
other
person
and
no
one
shall
enter
without
being
searched
by
me
as
the
king
hath
commanded
me
upon
this
the
old
woman
manifesting
anger
said
to
him
i
knew
that
thou
wast
a
man
of
sense
and
of
good
manners
and
if
thou
art
changed
i
will
acquaint
her
with
this
and
inform
her
that
thou
hast
offered
opposition535
to
her
female
slave
she
then
called
out
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
said
to
him
advance
o
slave-girl
and
immediately
he
entered
the
antechamber
as
she
had
commanded
him
and
the
eunuch
was
silent
and
said
no
more
so
tÃj-el-mulook
counted
five
doors
and
entered
the
sixth
and
found
the
lady
dunyÃ

standing
expecting
him

tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

as
soon
as
she
beheld
him
she
knew
him
and
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
and
he
embraced
her
in
like
manner
and
the
old
woman
coming
in
to
them
contrived
a
pretext
to
dismiss
the
female
slaves
after
which
the
lady
dunyÃ

said
to
her
be
thou
keeper
of
the
door
she
then
remained
alone
with
tÃj-el-mulook
and
they
passed
the
whole
night
in
innocent
dalliance66
and
on
the
following
morning
she
closed
the
door
upon
him
and
the
old
woman
and
entering
another
apartment
sat
there
according
to
her
custom
and
her
female
slaves
came
to
her
and
she
transacted
their
affairs
and
conversed
with
them
and
then
said
to
them
go
forth
from
me
now
for
i
desire
to
amuse
myself
in
solitude
so
they
left
her
and
she
returned
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
old
woman
taking
with
her
some
food
for
them
and
thus
they
ceased
not
to
do
for
a
whole
month

as
to
the
wezeer
however
and
azeez
when
tÃj-el-mulook
had536
gone
to
the
palace
of
the
kings
daughter
and
remained
all
this
time
they
concluded
that
he
would
never
return
from
it
and
that
he
was
inevitably
lost
and
azeez
said
to
the
wezeer
o
my
father
what
wilt
thou
do
the
wezeer
answered
o
my
son
this
affair
is
one
of
difficulty
and
if
we
return
not
to
his
father
to
acquaint
him
he
will
blame
us
for
our
negligence
so
they
prepared
themselves
immediately
and
journeyed
towards
el-ará
el-khaárÃ

and
el-amoodeyn67
and
the
royal
residence
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
and
traversed
the
valleys
night
and
day
until
they
went
in
and
presented
themselves
before
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
and
they
informed
him
of
that
which
had
happened
to
his
son
and
that
they
had
learnt
no
news
of
him
since
he
had
entered
the
palace
of
the
kings
daughter
on
hearing
this
he
was
as
though
the
day
of
resurrection
had
surprised
him
his
sorrow
was
intense
and
he
gave
orders
to
make
a
proclamation
of
war
throughout
his
dominions
he
then
sent
forth
his
troops
outside
the
city
and
caused
the
tents
to
be
pitched
for
them
and
remained
in
his
pavilion
until
the
forces
had
assembled
from
all
the
quarters
of
his
kingdom
his
subjects
loved
him
for
his
great
justice
and
beneficence
and
he
departed
with
an
army
that
covered
the
earth
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
for
the
purpose
of
demanding
his
son
tÃj-el-mulook

in
the
meantime
tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

continued
together
for
half
a
year
every
day
increasing
in
mutual
love
and
the
love
and
distraction
and
rapture
of
tÃj-el-mulook
so
augmented
that
he
opened
to
her
his
mind
and
said
to
her
know
o
beloved
of
my
heart
that
the
longer
i
remain
with
thee
the
more
do
my
distraction
and
ecstasy
and
desire
increase
for
i
have
not
altogether
attained
my
wish
so
she
said
what
dost
thou
wish
o
light
of
my
eye
and
delight
of
my
heart
he
answered
i
desire
to
acquaint
thee
with
my
true
history
know
then
that
i
am
not
a
merchant
but
a
king
son
of
a
king
and
the
name
of
my
father
is
the
supreme
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
who
sent
the
wezeer
as
ambassador
to
thy
father
to
demand
thee
for
me
in
marriage
and
when
the
news
came
to
thee
thou
refusedst
to
consentâhe
then
related
to
her
his
story
from
first
to
last
and
added
i
desire
now
to
repair
to
my
father
that
he
may
send
an
ambassador
again
to
thy
father
to
demand
thee
in
marriage
from
him
and
so
we
shall
remain
at
easeâand
when
she
heard
this
she
rejoiced
exceedingly
for
it
coincided
with
her
wish
and
they
passed
the
next
night
determined
upon
this
proceeding

but
it
happened
in
accordance
with
destiny
that
sleep
overcame
them
unusually
that
night
and
they
remained
until
the
sun
had
risen537
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
was
then
upon
his
royal
seat
with
the
emeers
of
his
empire
before
him
and
the
chief
of
the
goldsmiths
presented
himself
having
in
his
hand
a
large
round
casket
and
he
advanced
and
opening
it
before
the
king
took
forth
from
it
an
elegant
box
worth
a
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
for
the
jewels
it
contained
and
rubies
and
emeralds
such
as
no
king
of
the
earth
could
procure
and
when
the
king
saw
it
he
wondered
at
its
beauty
and
he
looked
towards
the
chief
eunuch
to
whom
the
affair
with
the
old
woman
had
happened
as
above
described
and
said
to
him
o
kÃfoor68
take
this
box
and
go
with
it
to
the
lady
dunyÃ

so
the
eunuch
took
it
and
proceeded
until
he
arrived
at
the
chamber
of
the
kings
daughter
when
he
found
its
door
closed
and
the
old
woman
sleeping
at
its
threshold
and
he
exclaimed
until
this
hour
are
ye
sleeping
and
when
the
old
woman
heard
what
he
said
she
awoke
from
her
sleep
and
in
her
fear
of
him
said
wait
until
i
bring
the
key
she
then
went
forth
and
fled
the
eunuch
therefore
knew
that
she
was
alarmed
and
he
displaced
the
door69
and
entering
the
chamber
found
the
lady
dunyÃ

asleep
with
tÃj-el-mulook
at
the
sight
of
this
he
was
perplexed
at
his
case
and
was
meditating
to
return
to
the
king
when
the
lady
dunyÃ

awoke
and
found
him
by
her
and
she
was
troubled
and
her
countenance
became
pale
and
she
said
o
kÃfoor
veil
what
god
hath
veiled
but
he
replied
i
cannot
conceal
anything
from
the
king
and
he
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
returned
to
the
king
so
the
king
said
to
him
hast
thou
given
the
box
to
thy
mistress
the
eunuch
answered
take
the
box
here
it
is
i
cannot
conceal
from
thee
anything
know
that
i
beheld
with
the
lady
dunyÃ

a
handsome
young
man
sleeping
in
the
same
chamber
the
king
therefore
ordered
that
they
should
be
both
brought
before
him
and
when
they
had
come
into
his
presence
he
said
to
them
what
are
these
deeds
and
he
was
violently
enraged
and
seizing
a
dagger70
was
about
to
strike
with
it
tÃj-el-mulook
but
the
lady
dunyÃ

threw
her
head
upon
him
and
said
to
her
father
slay
me
before
him
the
king
however
chid
her
and
ordered
them
to
convey
her
back
to
her
chamber
then
looking
towards
tÃj-el-mulook
he
said
to
him
wo
to
thee
whence
art
thou
and
who
is
thy
father
and
what
hath
emboldened
thee
to
act
thus
towards
my
daughterâknow
o
king
answered
tÃj-el-mulook
that
if
thou
put
me
to
death
thou
wilt
perish
and
thou
and
all
in
thy
dominions
will
repentâand
why
so
said
the
king
he
answered
know
that
i
am
the
son
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
and
thou
wilt
not
be
aware
of
the
consequence
when538
he
will
approach
thee
with
his
horsemen
and
his
infantry
and
when
king
shÃh-zemÃn
heard
this
he
desired
to
defer
putting
him
to
death
and
to
imprison
him
until
he
should
see
whether
his
assertion
were
true
but
his
wezeer
said
to
him
o
king
of
the
age
it
is
my
advice
that
thou
hasten
the
execution
of
this
young
wretch
since
he
hath
been
guilty
of
presumption
towards
the
daughters
of
kings
so
he
said
to
the
executioner
strike
off
his
head
for
he
is
a
traitor
and
the
executioner
took
him
and
having
bound
him
firmly
raised
his
hand
and
made
a
sign
of
consultation
to
the
emeers
a
first
and
a
second
time
desiring
by
this
that
some
delay
might
take
place
but
the
king
called
out
to
him
how
long
wilt
thou
consult
if
thou
do
so
again
i
will
strike
off
thy
head

scene
on
the
arrival
of
the
troops
of
suleymÃn
shÃh
the
executioner
therefore
raised
his
hand
until
his
arm-pit
appeared
and
was
about
to
strike
off
his
head
when
loud
cries
were
heard
and
the
people
closed
their
shops
so
the
king
said
to
the
executioner
hasten
not
and
he
sent
a
person
to
learn
the
news
for
him
and
the
messenger
went
and
soon
returning
said
to
the
king
i
beheld
an
army
like
the
roaring
sea
agitated
with
waves
their
horses
are
prancing
and
the
earth
trembleth
beneath
them
and
i539
know
not
wherefore
they
are
come
and
the
king
was
amazed
and
feared
lest
he
should
be
deposed
from
his
throne
he
then
said
to
his
wezeer
have
none
of
our
troops
gone
forth
to
meet
this
army
but
his
words
were
not
finished
when
his
chamberlains
came
in
to
him
accompanied
by
the
messengers
of
the
approaching
king
and
among
them
was
the
wezeer
who
had
been
with
tÃj-el-mulook
he
commenced
by
salutation
and
the
king
rose
to
him
and
calling
them
near
to
him
asked
them
respecting
the
cause
of
their
coming
whereupon
the
wezeer
advanced
from
among
them
and
approached
the
king
and
said
to
him
know
that
he
who
hath
alighted
in
thy
territories
is
a
king
not
like
the
kings
who
have
preceded
him
nor
like
the
suláÃns
of
former
timesâand
who
is
he
said
the
king
the
wezeer
answered
he
is
the
lord
of
justice
and
security
the
fame
of
whose
magnanimity
the
caravans
have
spread
abroad
the
suláÃn
suleymÃn
shÃh
the
lord
of
el-ará
el-khaárÃ

and
el-amoodeyn
and
the
mountains
of
iápahÃn
who
loveth
justice
and
equity
and
hateth
tyranny
and
oppression
and
he
saith
to
thee
that
his
son
is
in
thy
dominions
and
in
thy
city
and
he
is
the
vital
spirit
of
his
heart
and
its
delight
and
if
he
find
him
in
safety
it
is
what
he
desireth
and
thou
wilt
be
thanked
and
praised
but
if
he
be
not
found
in
thy
country
or
if
any
evil
hath
befallen
him
receive
tidings
of
destruction
and
of
the
ruin
of
thy
territories
for
thy
country
shall
become
a
desert
in
which
the
raven
shall
croak
thus
i
have
delivered
to
thee
the
message
and
peace
be
on
theeâwhen
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
heard
these
words
of
the
envoy
his
heart
was
troubled
and
he
feared
for
his
kingdom
and
called
out
to
the
lords
of
his
empire
and
his
wezeers
and
chamberlains
and
lieutenants
and
when
they
had
come
before
him
he
said
to
them
wo
unto
you
go
down
and
search
for
this
young
manâbut
he
was
under
the
hand
of
the
executioner
and
his
appearance
was
changed
through
the
fear
that
he
suffered
the
wezeer
then
looking
aside
found
the
kings
son
upon
the
skin
of
blood71
and
he
recognised
him
and
arose
and
threw
himself
upon
him
so
also
did
the
other
messengers
they
then
unbound
him
and
kissed
his
hands
and
his
feet
whereupon
tÃj-el-mulook
opened
his
eyes
and
recognising
the
wezeer
and
his
companion
azeez
fell
down
in
a
swoon
through
the
excess
of
his
joy
at
their
presence

the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
was
perplexed
at
his
situation
and
in
great
fear
on
discovering
that
the
coming
of
the
army
was
on
account
of
this
young
man
and
he
arose
and
walked
forward
to
tÃj-el-mulook
and
kissed
his
head
and
with
weeping
eyes
said
to
him
o
my
son540
be
not
angry
with
me
be
not
angry
with
the
evil-doer
for
his
deed
but
have
compassion
on
my
gray
hairs
and
lay
not
waste
my
dominions
and
tÃj-el-mulook
approached
him
and
kissed
his
hand
saying
to
him
no
harm
shall
befall
thee
for
thou
art
in
my
estimation
as
my
father
but
beware
that
no
evil
befall
my
beloved
the
lady
dunyÃ
âo
my
lord
rejoined
the
king
fear
not
for
her
for
nought
but
happiness
awaiteth
her
and
he
proceeded
to
excuse
himself
to
him
and
to
soothe
the
mind
of
the
wezeer
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
promising
him
a
large
sum
of
money
that
he
might
conceal
from
the
king
what
he
had
seen
after
which
he
ordered
the
grandees
of
his
empire
to
take
tÃj-el-mulook
and
to
conduct
him
to
the
bath
to
clothe
him
in
a
suit
of
the
best
of
royal
apparel
and
bring
him
back
quickly
so
they
did
this
they
conducted
him
into
the
bath
and
having
clad
him
in
the
suit
which
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
had
allotted
him
brought
him
back
to
the
hall
of
audience
and
when
he
came
in
the
king
rose
to
him
he
and
all
the
lords
of
his
empire
and
they
all
stood
to
wait
upon
him
then
tÃj-el-mulook
sat
and
conversed
with
his
fathers
wezeer
and
with
azeez
respecting
the
events
which
had
happened
to
him
and
they
replied
during
that
period
we
went
to
thy
father
and
informed
him
that
thou
hadst
entered
the
palace
of
the
kings
daughter
and
not
come
forth
from
it
and
that
thy
case
appeared
doubtful
to
us
and
when
he
heard
this
he
made
ready
the
troops
and
we
came
to
this
country
and
on
our
arrival
have
experienced
joy
and
happiness
so
he
said
to
them
good
fortune
hath
attended
your
actions
first
and
last

the
king
in
the
meantime
had
gone
into
his
daughter
the
lady
dunyÃ

and
found
her
weeping
for
tÃj-el-mulook
she
had
taken
a
sword
and
put
its
hilt
to
the
floor
and
its
point
to
the
middle
of
her
bosom
and
was
leaning
over
it
saying
i
must
kill
myself
and
not
live
after
my
beloved
when
her
father
therefore
went
in
to
her
and
beheld
her
in
this
state
he
called
out
to
her
and
said
o
mistress
of
the
daughters
of
kings
do
it
not
but
have
mercy
upon
thy
father
and
the
people
of
thy
country
then
advancing
to
her
he
said
to
her
i
conjure
thee
to
abstain
lest
evil
befall
thy
father
on
thy
account
and
he
acquainted
her
with
the
case
telling
her
that
her
beloved
the
son
of
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
desired
to
celebrate
his
marriage
with
her
and
adding
the
affair
of
the
betrothal
and
marriage
is
committed
to
thy
judgment
and
she
smiled
and
said
to
him
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
suláÃn
i
will
make
him
crucify
thee
upon
a
piece
of
wood
worth
a
couple
of
pieces
of
silver541i
conjure
thee
by
allah
he
exclaimed
that
thou
have
mercy
upon
thy
fatherâgo
to
him
she
rejoined
and
bring
him
to
me
he
replied
on
the
head
and
the
eye
and
he
returned
from
her
quickly
and
going
in
to
tÃj-el-mulook
rejoiced
him
by
what
he
said
he
then
arose
with
him
and
went
to
her
again
and
when
she
beheld
tÃj-el-mulook
she
embraced
him
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
clung
to
him
and
said
to
him
thou
hast
made
me
desolate
by
thine
absence
then
looking
at
her
father
she
said
can
any
one
act
injuriously
towards
such
a
person
as
this
handsome
youth
and
he
a
king
a
son
of
a
king
and
upon
this
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
went
forth
and
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
repairing
to
the
wezeer
and
the
other
messengers
of
the
father
of
tÃj-el-mulook
ordered
them
to
inform
the
suláÃn
suleymÃn
shÃh
that
his
son
was
in
prosperity
and
health
and
enjoying
a
life
of
the
utmost
delight
he
gave
orders
also
to
carry
forth
provisions
and
pay
to
the
troops
of
the
suláÃn
suleymÃn
shÃh
and
after
they
had
conveyed
all
that
he
commanded
them
to
take
forth
he
brought
out
a
hundred
coursers
and
a
hundred
dromedaries
and
a
hundred
memlooks
and
a
hundred
concubine
slaves
and
a
hundred
male
black
slaves
and
a
hundred
female
slaves
and
sent
them
all
to
him
as
a
present

the
horses
sent
to
suleymÃn
shÃh
he
then
repaired
to
him
with
the
lords
of
his
empire
and
his
chief
attendants
and
they
proceeded
until
they
arrived
outside
the
city
and
when
the
suláÃn
suleymÃn
shÃh
became
acquainted
with
this
he
advanced
some
paces
to
meet
him
the
wezeer
and
azeez
had
informed
him
of
the
news
and
he
rejoiced
and
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
granted
my
son
the
accomplishment
of
his
wish
and
he
embraced
the
king
shÃh-zemÃn
and
seated
him
by
his
side
upon
the
couch
and
they
conversed
together
after
which
the
attendants
placed
before
them
the
food
and
when
they
had
eaten
to
satisfaction542
they
brought
them
the
sweetmeats
soon
after
tÃj-el-mulook
came
approaching
in
his
rich
and
ornamented
dress
and
when
his
father
beheld
him
he
rose
to
him
and
kissed
him
and
all
who
were
present
rose
to
him
and
after
he
had
sat
with
them
a
while
conversing
the
king
suleymÃn
shÃh
said
i
desire
to
perform
my
sons
contract
of
marriage
to
thy
daughter
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
and
king
shÃh-zemÃn
replied
i
hear
and
obey
so
he
summoned
the
áÃáee
and
witnesses
and
they
came
and
wrote
the
marriage-contract
and
the
troops
rejoiced
at
this
and
king
shÃh-zemÃn
began
to
fit
out
his
daughter

then
tÃj-el-mulook
said
to
his
father
verily
azeez
is
a
generous
person
he
hath
performed
for
me
a
great
service
and
wearied
himself
and
journeyed
with
me
and
enabled
me
to
attain
the
object
of
my
search
ceasing
not
to
exhort
me
to
patience
until
i
accomplished
my
wish
and
he
hath
been
with
us
two
years
separated
from
his
country
it
is
my
desire
therefore
that
we
should
prepare
for
him
merchandise
for
his
country
is
near
his
father
replied
thy
opinion
is
excellent
so
they
prepared
for
him
a
hundred
loads
of
the
most
costly
stuffs
and
tÃj-el-mulook
bade
him
farewell
saying
to
him
o
my
brother
accept
this
as
a
present
and
he
accepted
it
and
kissed
the
ground
before
him
and
before
his
father
tÃj-el-mulook
then
mounted
his
horse
and
proceeded
with
azeez
for
the
space
of
three
miles
after
which
azeez
conjured
him
to
return
and
said
were
it
not
for
my
mother
i
could
not
endure
thy
separation
and
by
allah
i
entreat
thee
not
to
cease
acquainting
me
with
thy
state
having
thus
said
he
bade
him
farewell
and
repaired
to
his
city
he
found
that
his
mother
had
built
for
him
a
tomb
in
the
midst
of
the
house
and
she
frequently
visited
it
and
when
he
entered
the
house
he
found
that
she
had
dishevelled
her
hair
and
spread
it
upon
the
tomb
and
with
streaming
eyes
was
reciting
these
versesâ

by
allah
o
tomb
have
his
charms
perished
and
hath
that
brilliant
countenance
changed
o
tomb
thou
art
neither
a
garden
nor
a
firmament
how
then
can
the
full
moon
and
flowers
be
united
in
thee
she
then
groaned
and
recited
some
other
verses
but
before
she
had
finished
azeez
went
in
to
her
and
when
she
beheld
him
she
rose
to
him
and
embraced
him
and
asked
him
respecting
his
long
absence
so
he
acquainted
her
with
all
the
events
that
had
happened
to
him
from
first
to
last
and
told
her
that
tÃj-el-mulook
had
given
him
of
wealth
and
stuffs
a
hundred
loads
and
she
rejoiced
at
thisâsuch
was
the
history
of
azeez543

now

returned

tÃj-el-mulook
and
his

continued
their

night
and
day
until
they
came
in

of
their
country
the
city

decorated
for
them
and
they
entered

and
the

the
next
story
to
that
of
ghÃnim
in
my
original
is
one
of
very
great
length
comprising
the
greater
part
of
the
forty-fourth
night
and
extending
to
the
end
of
the
hundred
and
forty-fifth
but
interrupted
by
the
contents
of
my
eighth
chapter
which
consists
of
two
stories
of
a
very
different
kind
that
appear
to
have
been
introduced
to
relieve
its
tediousness
with
these
it
occupies
nearly
162
pages
or
not
much
less
than
an
eighth
part
of
the
whole
work
it
is
the
story
of
the
king
omar
en-noáºmÃn
and
his
two
sons
sharr-kÃn360
and
áŒÃ-el-mekÃn361
and
his
daughter
nuzhet-ez-zemÃn362
c
it
is
entirely
a
fiction
professedly
relating
to
the
first
century
of
the
mohammadan
era
before
the
reign
of
the
khaleefeh
abd-el-melik
the
son
of
marwÃn
and
its
main
subject
is
a
war
with
two
greek
kings
taken
altogether
i
deem
it
unworthy
of
a
place
in
the
present
series
of
tales
and
so
much
of
it
depends
upon
incidents
of
a
most
objectionable
nature
that
i
cannot
attempt
to
abridge
it
but
a
pleasant
tale
might
be
composed
from
it
by
considerable
alterations

one
of
the
two
stories
which
i
have
extracted
from
it
that
of
tÃj-el-mulook
and
the
lady
dunyÃ

bears
apparent
indications
of
a
persian
origin
but
in
their
present
state
the
manners
and
customs
c
which
both
exhibit
are
arab
the
scenes
of
the
events
narrated
in
the
story
of
tÃj-el-mulook
are
in
persia
and
probably
in
india

imaginary
names
appear
to
be
given
to

its
locality
is
thereby
sufficiently
indicated
that
of
el-ará
el-beyáÃ

the
white
country
i
suppose
to
be
in
persia
or
india
and
as
to
the
islands
of
camphor
i
fancy
we
must
be
content
to
consider
them
vaguely
as
appertaining
to
india
the
country
in
which
azeez
and
azeezeh
resided
is
said
to
have
been
near
to
the
islands
of
camphor
but
their
story
is
perfectly
arabâthe

by

the
prophet
david
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
person
who
manufactured
coats
of

and
the
cause
of
his
applying
himself
to
the

thisâhe
used
to

in

approached

respecting

conduct

praised
him

prayed
for
him

one
day
as
he
was
asking
questions
respecting
himself

sent
to
him
an

the
heart
of

simple
mode

lady

wortley

charming
letters

has
gratified
our
curiosity
by
a
turkish
love-letter
of
this
kind369
a
specimen
of
one
from
an
arab
with
its
answer
may
be
here
addedâan
arab
lover
sent
to
his
mistress
a
fan
a
bunch
of
flowers
a
silk
tassel
some
sugar-candy
and
a
piece
of
a
chord
of
a
musical
instrument
and
she
returned
for
answer
a
piece
of
an
aloe-plant
three
black
cumin-seeds
and
a
piece
of
a
plant
used
in
washing370
his
communication
is
thus
interpretedâthe
fan
being
called
mirwaáah
a
word
derived
from
a
root
which
has
among
its
meanings
that
of
going
to
any
place
in
the
evening
signified
his
wish
to
pay
her
an
evening
visit
the
flowers
that
the
interview
should
be
in
her
garden
the
tassel
being
called
shurrÃbeh
that
they
should
have

sugar-candy
being
termed
sukkar

to
remain
in
her
company
until
the
morning
and
the
piece
of
a
chord
that
they
should
be
entertained
by
music
the
interpretation
of
her
answer
is
as
followsâthe
piece
of
an
aloe-plant
which
is
called
áabbÃrah
from
áabr
which
signifies
patienceâbecause
it
will
live
for
many
months
together

water

that
he
must
wait
the
three
black
cumin-seeds
explained
to
him
that
the
period
of
delay
should
be
three
nights
and
the
plant
used
in
washing
informed
him
that
she
should
then
have
gone
to
the
bath
and
would
meet
him372âi
have
omitted
one
symbol
in
the
ladys
answer
as
it
conveys
an
allusion
not
so
consistent
with
european
as
with
arab
notions
of
female
delicacy

the
language
of
flowers
employed
by
the
turks
does
not
exactly
agree
with
the
system
illustrated
in
the
story
of
azeez
and
azeezeh
for
the
former
consists
of
a
collection
of
words
and
phrases
or
sentences
which
rhyme
with
the
names
of
the
objects
used
as
the
signs373
this
system
is
also
employed
by
the
arabs
but
i
believe
not
so
commonly
as
the
other

a
remarkable
faculty
is
displayed
by
some
arabs
in
catching
the
meaning
of
secret
signs
employed
in
written
communications
to
them
such
signs
being
often
used
in
political
and
other
intrigues
the
following
is
a
curious
instanceâthe
celebrated
poet
el-mutanebbee
having
written
some
verses
in
dispraise
of
kÃfoor
el-ikhsheedee
the
independent
governor
of
egypt
was
obliged
to
flee
and
hide
himself
in
a
distant
town
kÃfoor
was
informed
of
his
retreat
and
desired
his
secretary
to
write
to
him
a
letter
promising
him
pardon
and
commanding
him
to
return
but
told
the
writer
at
the
same
time
that
when
the
poet
came
he
would
punish
him
the
secretary
was
a
friend
of
the
poet
and
being
obliged
to
read
the
letter
to
the
prince
when
he
had
written
it
was
perplexed
how
to
convey
to
el-mutanebbee
some
indication
of
the
danger
that
awaited
him
he
could
only
venture
to
do
so
in
the
exterior
address
and
having
written
this
in
the
usual
form
commencing
in
shÃa-llÃh
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
this
shall
arrive
c
he
put
a
small
mark
of
reduplication
over
the
n
in
the
first
word
which
he
thus
converted
into
inna
the
filial
vowel
being
understood
the
poet
read
the
letter
and
was
rejoiced
to
see
a
promise
of
pardon
but
on
looking
a
second
time
at
the
address
was
surprised
to
observe
the
mark
of
reduplication
over
the
n
knowing
the
writer
to
be
his
friend
he
immediately
suspected
a
secret
meaning
and
rightly
conceived
that
the
sign
conveyed
an
allusion
to
a
passage
in
the
áur-Ãn
commencing
with
the
word
inna
and
this
he
divined
to
be
the
followingâverily
the
magistrates
are
deliberating
concerning
thee
to
put
thee
to
death374
accordingly
he
fled
to
another
townâsome
authors
add
that
he
wrote
a
reply
conveying
by
a
similar
sign
to
his
friend
an
allusion
to
another
passage
in
the
áur-Ãnâwe
will
never
enter
the
country
while
they
remain
therein375âit
is
probable
that
signs
thus
employed
were
used
by
many
persons
to
convey
allusions
to
certain
words
and
such
may
have
been
the
case
in
the
above-mentioned
instance
if
not
the
poet
was
indeed
a
wonderful
guesser

the

probably
the
origin

both
bear

here

four

el-áazweenee

a
remark
somewhat
similar
to
this

account
of

but
the
interpretation
of
the
meaning
conveyed
by
the
date-stone
in

text
is
very
far-fetched
my
sheykh
in
a
marginal
note
gives
one
perfectly
apposite

date-stone

called
nawÃyeh
and
more
properly
nawÃh

nawÃ

and
the
last
of
these
words
signifies
also
distance
absence
c
and
is
often
used
to
express
the
state
of
one
who
is
far
from
loving

being
a

also
in

dirhem
i
have
before
mentioned
is
the
name
of
a
silver
coin
it
is
also
the
name
of
a
weight
very
nearly
equivalent
to
forty-eight
english
grains
and
being
here
described
as
of
iron
we
must
understand
it
in
the
latter
sense

note
31
i
suppose
the
iron
dirhem
to
be
symbolic
of
the
eye
because
it
is
round
and
perhaps
likewise
because
the
arabic
term
for
iron
namely
áadeed
has
also
the
signification
of
sharp
or
piercing
in
which
sense
it
is
often
applied

from
this
double
oath
it
seems
to
me
probable
that
by
the
circular
form
of
the
dirhem
an
allusion
was
meant
to
god
as
being
without
beginning

that

it
was
composed
from
what

in
a
vague
manner
and
as
it
is
my
object
in
the
present
work
to
give
such
illustrations
as
will
satisfy
the
general
reader
without
obliging
him
to
refer
to
other
books
i
shall
here
insert
an
abridged
extract
descriptive
of
a
zikr
from
my
account
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
modern
egyptians

the
zikkeers
or
performers
of
the
zikr
who
were
about
thirty
in
number
sat
cross-legged
upon
matting
extended
close
to
the
houses
on
one
side
of
the
street
in
the
form
of
an
oblong
ring377
within
this
ring
along
the
middle
of
the
matting
were
placed
three
very
large
wax
candles
each
about
four
feet
high
and
stuck
in
a
low
candlestick
most
of
the
zikkeers
were
aámedee
darweeshes
persons
of
the
lower
orders
and
meanly
dressed
many
of
them
wore
green
turbans
at
one
end
of
the
ring
were
four
munshids
or
singers
of
religious
odes
and
with
them
was
a
player
on
the
kind
of
flute
called
nÃy
i
procured
a
small
seat
of
palm-sticks
from
a
coffee-shop
close
by
and
by
means
of
a
little
pushing
and
the
assistance
of
my
servant
obtained
a
place
with
the
munshids
and
sat
there
to
hear
a
complete
act
or
meglis
of
the
zikr
which
act
commenced
at
about
three
oclock
or
three
hours
after
sunset
and
continued
two
hours

the
performers
began
by
reciting
the
fÃtáah
or
opening
chapter
of
the
áur-Ãn
all
together
their
sheykh
or
chief
first
exclaiming
el-fÃtáah
they
then
chanted
the
following
wordsâo
god
bless
our
lord
moáammad
among
the
former
genera551tions
and
bless
our
lord
moáammad
among
the
latter
generations
and
bless
our
lord
moáammad
in
every
time
and
period
and
bless
our
lord
moáammad
in
the
highest
degree
unto
the
day
of
judgment
and
bless
all
the
prophets
and
apostles
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
and
may
god
whose
name
be
blessed
and
exalted
be
well
pleased
with
our
lords
and
our
masters
those
persons
of
illustrious
estimation
aboo-bekr
and
omar
and
osmÃn
and
alee
and
with
all
the
favourites
of
god
god
is
our
sufficiency
and

the
guardian
there
is
no
strength
nor
power
but
in
god
the
high
the
great
o
god
o
our
lord
o
thou
liberal
of
pardon
o
thou
most
bountiful
of
the
most
bountiful
o
god
amenâthey
were
then
silent
for
three
or
four
minutes
and
again
recited
the
fÃtáah
but
silently
this
form
of
prefacing
the
zikr
is
commonly
used
by
almost
all
orders
of
darweeshes
in
egypt

the
performers
now
commenced
the
zikr
sitting
in
the
manner
above
described
they
chanted
in
slow
measure
lÃ
ilÃha
illa-llÃh
there
is
no
deity
but
god
to
the
following
airâ

music
bowing
the
head
and
body
twice
in
each
repetition
of
lÃ
ilÃha
illa-llÃh
thus
they
continued
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
for
about
the
same
space
of
time
they
repeated
the
same
words
to
the
same
air
but
in
a
quicker
measure
and
with
correspondingly
quicker
motions
in
the
meantime
the
munshids
frequently
sang
to
the
same
or
a
variation
of
the
same
air
portions
of
a
áaáeedeh
or
of
a
muweshshaá
an
ode
of
a
similar
nature
to
the
song
of
solomon
generally
alluding
to
the
prophet
as
the
object
of
love
and
praise
and
at
frequent
intervals
one
of
them
sang
out
the
word
meded
implying
an
invocation
for
spiritual
or
supernatural
aid

the
zikkeers
after
having
performed
as
above
described
next
repeated
the
same
words
to
a
different
air
for
about
the
same
length
of
time
first
very
slowly
then
quickly
the
air
was
as
followsâ

music
then
they
repeated
these
words
again
to
the
following
air
in
the
same
mannerâ

music
they
next
rose
and
standing
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
had
been
sitting
repeated
the
same
words
to
another
air
after
which
still
standing
they
repeated
these
words
in
a
very
deep
and
hoarse
tone
laying
the
principal
emphasis
upon
the
word
lÃ
and
the
first
syllable
of
the
last
word
allah
and
uttering
it
apparently
with
a
considerable
effort
the
sound
much
resembled
that
which
is
produced
by
beating
the
rim
of
a
tambourine
each
zikkeer
turned
his
head
alternately
to
the
right
and
left
at
each
repetition
of
lÃ
ilÃha
illa-llÃh
one
of
them
a
eunuch
at
this
part
of
the
zikr
was
seized
with
an
epileptic
fit
evidently
the
result
of
a
high
state
of
religious
excitement
but
nobody
seemed
surprised
at
it
for
occurrences
of
this
kind
at
zikrs
are
not
uncommon
all
the
performers
now
seemed
much
excited
repeating
their
ejaculations
with
greater
rapidity
violently
turning
their
heads
and
sinking
the
whole
body
at
the
same
time
some
of
them
jumping
the
eunuch
above
mentioned
again
was
seized
with
fits
several
times
and
i
generally
remarked
that
this
happened
after
one
of
the
munshids
had
sung
a
line
or
two
and
exerted
himself
more
than
usually
to
excite
his
hearers
the
singing
was
indeed
to
my
taste
very
pleasing
the
contrast
presented
by
the
vehement
and
distressing
exertions
of
the
performers
at
the
close
of
the
zikr
and
their
calm
gravity
and
solemnity
of
manner
at
the
commencement
was
particularly
striking
money
was
collected
during
the
performance
for
the
munshids
the
zikkeers

no
pay

48âon
oaths
to
explain
this
passage
i
must
repeat
with
a
few
slight
additions
some
remarks
which
i
have
made
in
a
former
publication380âamong
a
people
by
whom
falsehood
in
certain
cases
is
not
only
allowed
but
commended381
oaths
of
different
kinds
are
more
or
less
binding
in
considering
this
subject
we
should
also
553remember
that
oaths
may
sometimes
be
expiated382
there
are
some
oaths
which
i
believe
few
muslims
would
falsely
take
such
as
saying
three
times
by
god
the
great
wa-llÃhi-l-aáºeem
and
the
oath
upon
the
muá-áaf
or
copy
of
the
áur-Ãn
saying
by
what
this
contains
of
the
word
of
god
this
latter
is
rendered
more
binding
by
placing
a
sword
with
the
sacred
volume
and
still
more
so
by
the
addition
of
a
cake
or
piece
of
bread
and
a
handful
of
salt
but
a
form
of
oath
which
is
generally
yet
more
to
be
depended
upon
is
that
of
saying
i
impose
upon
myself
divorcement
that
is
the
divorce
of
my
wife
if
what
i
say
be
false
or
i
impose
upon
myself
interdiction
which
has
a
similar
meaning
my
wife
be
unlawful
to
me
or
i
impose
upon
myself
a
triple
divorcement
which
binds
a
man
by
the
irrevocable
divorce
of
his
wife
if
a
man
use
any
of
these
three
forms
of
oath
falsely
his
wife
if
he
have
but
one
is
divorced
by
the
oath
itself
if
proved
to
be
false
without
the
absolute
necessity
of
any
further
ceremony
and
if
he
have
two
or
more
wives
he
must
under
such
circumstances
choose
one
of
them
to
put
away

in
the
case
which
this
note
is
principally
intended
to
illustrate
the
wife
of
azeez
makes
him
swear
by
the
sword
and
the
áur-Ãn
in
the
hope
of
inducing
him
to
return
to
her
and
by
the
oath
of
divorce
to
make
the
inducement
more
strong
and
that
she
might
be
enabled
in
case
he
did
not
fulfil
his
vow
legally
to
contract
another
marriage

my
sheykh
has
remarked
in
a
marginal
note
on
the
five
elders
or
sheykhs
here
mentioned
the
known
number
is
the
four
namely
the
first
four
khaleefehs
or
the
four
welees
eminent
saints
the
seyyid
el-bedawee
and
the
seyyid
ed-dasooáee
and
er-rifÃee
and
el-geelÃnee
the
latter
four
are
often
mentioned
together
as
being
the
saints
generally
most
esteemed
in
the
present
day
and
the
founders
of
the
four
principal
orders
of
darweeshesâwho
then
can
be
meant
by
the
five
elders
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
retained
this
number
as
it
occurs
again
in
a
variation
of
the
same
verses
in
a
subsequent
tale
which
is
almost
exactly
the
same
as
that
of

the
gait
of
arab
ladies
is
very
remarkable
they
incline
the
lower
part
of
the
body
from
side
to
side
as
they
step
and
with
the
hands
raised
to
the
level
of
the
bosom
they
hold
the
edges
of
their
outer
covering
their
pace
is
slow
and
they
look
not
about
them
but
keep
their
eyes
towards
the
ground
in
the
direction
to
which
they
are
going

note
66
it
should
be
remarked
here
that
the
private
room
of
an
eastern
princess
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
western
bed-room
in
the
east
a
guest
may
lay
himself
down
upon
a
deewÃn
in
the
presence
of
another
to
pass
the
night
without
any
infringement
of
decorum

the
doors
in
eastern
houses
generally
turn
on
two
wooden
pins
one
fitting
into
a
hole
in
the
lintel
the
other
into
a
hole
immediately
behind
the
threshold
and
the
latter
is
very
short
it
is
therefore
often
easy
to
displace
a
door
by
raising
it
a
little
which
may
be
done
by
means
of
a
projecting
wooden
lock
and
in
many
cases
when
the
door
cannot
be
displaced
from
its
sockets
it
may
be
raised
sufficiently
to
remove
the
inner
latch
from
its
catch
the
doors
of
the
ancient
temples
and
tombs
in
egypt
were
formed
as
above
described
with
pins
which
were
often
made
of
bronze

note

i
here
read
nimsheh
also
written
nimjeh
and
nimjÃhâfrom
the
persian
neemjah
instead
of
áamsheh
the
latter
is
described
by
my
sheykh
in
a
marginal
note
as
a
strip
of
leather
divided
into
two
and
tied
together
and
nailed
at
the
upper
end
to
a
piece
of
wood
but
the
use
of
such
an
instrument
in
this
case
would
be
ridiculous
the
name
of
nimsheh
is
often
given
to
a
royal
dagger555

note

as
persons
are
often
decapitated
in
an
eastern
palace
a
skin
is
made
use
of
to
receive
the
head
and
the
blood
i
believe
it
to
be
similar
to
the
round
skin
used
by
travellers
to
eat
upon
which
is
converted
into
a
bag
by
means
of
a
running
string
round
the
edge

in
concluding
the
present
series
of
notes
i
may
state
my
opinion
that
the
two
stories
to
which
they
relate
are
fully
worthy
of
insertion
in
this
collection
as
extending
the
picture
of
arab
